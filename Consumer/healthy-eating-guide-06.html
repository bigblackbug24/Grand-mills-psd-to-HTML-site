                            <p>Posted by Melissa Breyer Feb 2, 2009</p>
                            
                            <p>When did we become so hungry for health-miracles and super-cures? Has it always been like this–or is it a more recent desire borne from the fear of ill health caused by the modern world? All I know is that when I consider the struggle our bodies are up against–air and water pollution, synthetic and processed foods, chemical toxins–I find myself clinging to every last study, report and trend that promotes beneficial health claims!</p>
                            
                    <p>Which brings me to super foods. Super foods. What a brilliant concept, and how well it plays into the current health zeitgeist: Simple, healthy foods teeming with antioxidants that patrol our bodies and smack down those villainous free radicals, thus taming cell destruction. My heroes! It makes one want to eat nothing but goji berries and pomegranate juice–take those free radicals!</p>
                    
                    <p>Many say that the antioxidant action provided by super foods protects against cancer and heart disease, among a host of other ills–while others point out that few carefully controlled studies have been conducted. All I know is that eating food that has a high ORAC value (the rating system for antioxidants) feels deeply, instinctively right to me. Maybe I have been brainwashed by the hype, but at the very least, I know that eating a wide variety of pure, whole food is a very good thing. </p>
                    
                        <p>I also know that it’s important for the sake of sustainability to eat as locally as possible, which makes eating many of the fresh super food fruit and vegetables for those of us in colder climes more of a challenge. But this opens the door to preserved foods and winter produce. These are the unsung superstars–the dried, frozen, cold-stored and cruciferous crew–they may not glam up like their bright and shiny summer cousins, but they are clearly the humble heroes here. With that in mind, I went over the USDA list of foods with the highest antioxidant levels and sifted out the ones that work well in the winter months.</p>
                        <p>Here are the contenders for the top winter super foods, all of these scored within the top 20 antioxidant-containing foods according to the USDA:</p>
                        
                         <h5>Cinnamon</h5>                                
                                                          
                            <p>Cinnamon has one of the highest antioxidant levels on the list, and has an added bonus in that it may help you better regulate your blood-glucose levels. Although I realize that cinnamon’s not exactly a “local” product for those of us not in Indonesia, it doesn’t seem like the worst offender in terms of carbon footprint–one little stick goes a long way.</p>
                            <h5>Pecans</h5>
                            <p>People always lament that the tasty things are the worst things for our health–case in point: French fries. But, how about pecans? Yum! Pecans have shown to significantly lower LDL cholesterol and increase HDL. Frequent consumption of nuts is associated with a lowered risk of sudden cardiac death and other coronary heart disease, as well as a lower risk of Type II diabetes in women. A handful of pecans can brighten a meal, but make Vegan Pumpkin Pecan Pie for full-on swooning.</p>
         					<h5>Dark Chocolate</h5>                                                 
                            <p>A Penn State-led review of the available evidence from 66 published studies, supports the view that consuming flavonoid-rich chocolate, in moderation, can be associated with reduced risk for cardiovascular disease. Chocolate that is minimally processed and has the highest cocoa content (which means the darkest chocolate) has the highest level of flavonoids. With dark chocolate, even eating as little as 30 calories per day can have a moderate effect. (But more can make you really happy.)</p>

                        <div class="col-md-4">
                           <h5>Pomegranate Juice</h5>
                            <p>Pomegranates offer very high antioxidant activity–and research shows that drinking pomegranate juice may help with lowering the risk for hardening of the arteries or atherosclerosis. I find eating pomegranate fruit one of life’s simple pleasures, but for a daily dose, pomegranate juice is more accessible.</p>
                             <h5>Red Delicious Apples</h5>
                            <p>In addition to high anti-oxidant levels, apples have a huge array of excellent health benefits. Although I’m crazy about heirloom varieties that I can get locally, Red Delicious apples scored the highest for anti-oxidant levels on the USDA list; but I’m sure the USDA didn’t tackle a huge variety of apples for testing. I wonder how my local Esopus Spitzenberg or Hudson’s Golden Gem varieties would have scored? Along with the high antioxidant magic from apples, they are also rich in pectin, a form of soluble fiber known to help lower cholesterol.</p>
                            
                             <h5>Frozen Blueberries</h5>
                            <p>Blueberries are the rock stars of high-antioxidant fruit and vegetable family–they have a super high ORAC level, are widely available, and easy to eat. Even though freezing can degrade some of the nutrients, frozen blueberries are available year-round and don’t spoil. Frozen blueberries work well plain, on cereal, in smoothies–and incorporate nicely into baked goods.</p>
                             <h5>Prunes</h5>
                            <p>I know they generally go by the more rustically glamorous, marketing-friendly name of dried plums these days, but I say, call a prune a prune. Prunes are very high in anti-oxidants, and are a good source of energy in the form of simple sugars, yet they do not cause a rapid rise in blood sugar concentration, possibly because of high fiber, fructose, and sorbitol content. Additionally, the high potassium content of prunes might be beneficial for cardiovascular health. Plums are an important source of boron, which is thought to play a role in prevention of osteoporosis. Pureed prunes make a miraculous substitute for fat in baked goods.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Red or Kidney Dried Beans</h5>
                            <p>An excellent source of protein, antioxidants, folic acid, potassium, dietary fiber and complex carbohydrates, beans are flavorful, nutritionally dense, inexpensive and versatile. </p>
                            
                            <h5>Russet Potatoes</h5>
                            <p>Potatoes got a bad reputation in modern nutrition lore, most likely because of their high starch content–but potatoes are awesome. They contain no fat or cholesterol, have 3 grams of protein per medium potato, 2 grams of fiber (with skin on), which may aid in weight loss, lower blood cholesterol levels and decrease risk of heart disease. They have 45% Daily Value (DV) of vitamin C and 18% DV of potassium. Russet potatoes are specifically high on the list, but as is the case with apples, I’m sure the USDA tested a limited variety of potatoes. I imagine that the deep-hued varieties have even more anti-oxidants, like the Adirondack Red or Peruvian Purple.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Cabbage</h5>
                            <p>A New York Times article in December suggests that cabbage is the most important [vegetable] in the world from the point of view of nutritional benefits and cancer-fighting ability. Cabbage possesses phytochemicals including sulforaphane, which studies suggest protects the body against cancer-causing free radicals, and indoles, which help metabolize estrogens. It’s also an excellent source of vitamins K and C, and a very good source of dietary fiber, vitamin B6, folate, manganese and Omega 3 fatty acids. Slaw is the obvious application for cabbage.</p>

                        <div class="col-md-4">
                                
<p>A professor at CCNY for a physiological psych class told his class about bananas. He said the expression "going bananas" is from the effects of bananas on the brain.</p>
                              
<p>Never, put your banana in the refrigerator!<br>After reading this, you'll never look at a banana in the same way again.</p>
                             
                           <p>Bananas contain three natural sugars - sucrose, fructose & glucose combined with fiber. A banana gives an instant, sustained & substantial boost of energy. 
Research has proven that just two bananas provide enough energy for a strenuous 90-minute workout. No wonder the banana is the number one fruit with the world's leading athletes. 
</p>

                           <p>But energy isn't the only way a banana can help us keep fit. It can also help overcome or prevent a substantial number of illnesses & conditions, making it a must to add to our daily diet.</p>
                           <h5>Depression:</h5>
                           <p>According to a recent survey undertaken by MIND amongst people suffering from depression, many felt much better after eating a banana. This is because bananas contain tryptophan, a type of protein that the body converts into serotonin, known to make you relax, improve your mood & generally make you feel happier.</p>
                           
                            <h5>PMS:</h5>
                           <p>Forget the pills - eat a banana. The vitamin B6 it contains regulates blood glucose levels, which can affect your mood.</p>
                           <h5>Anemia: </h5>
                           <p>High in iron, bananas can stimulate the production of hemoglobin in the blood & so helps in cases of anemia. </p>
                            <h5>Blood Pressure:  </h5>
                           <p>This unique tropical fruit is extremely high in potassium yet low in salt, making it perfect to beat blood pressure. So much so, the US Food & Drug Administration has just allowed the banana industry to make official claims for the fruit's ability to reduce the risk of blood pressure & stroke.</p>
                           
                           <h5>Brain Power:</h5>
                           <p>200 students at a Twickenham (Middlesex) school (England) were helped through their exams this year by eating bananas at breakfast, break, & lunch in a bid to boost their brain power. Research has shown that the potassium-packed fruit can assist learning by making pupils more alert.</p>
                           
                           <h5>Constipation:</h5>
                           <p>High in fiber, including bananas in the diet can help restore normal bowel action, helping to overcome the problem without resorting to laxatives.</p>
                           
                           <h5>Hangovers:</h5>
                           <p>One of the quickest ways of curing a hangover is to make a banana milkshake, sweetened with honey. The banana calms the stomach &, with the help of the honey, builds up depleted blood sugar levels, while the milk soothes & re-hydrates your system.</p>
                           
                            <h5>Heartburn:</h5>
                           <p>Bananas have a natural antacid effect in the body; so if you suffer from heartburn, try eating a banana for soothing relief.</p>
                          	
                            <h5>Morning Sickness:</h5>
                          <p>Snacking on bananas between meals helps to keep blood sugar levels up & avoid morning sickness.</p>
                          
                          
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4">
                        	<h5>Mosquito bites:</h5>
                          <p>Before reaching for the insect bite cream, try rubbing the affected area with the inside of a banana skin. Many people find it amazingly successful at reducing swelling & irritation.</p>
                          
                          <h5>Nerves:</h5>
                          <p>Bananas are high in B vitamins that help calm the nervous system.<br>
                          Overweight and at work? 
                          <p>Studies at the Institute of Psychology in Austria found pressure at work leads to gorging on comfort food like chocolate & chips. Looking at 5,000 hospital patients, researchers found the most obese were more likely to be in high-pressure jobs. The report concluded that, to avoid panic-induced food cravings, we need to control our blood sugar levels by snacking on high carbohydrate foods every two hours to keep levels steady.</p>
                          </p>
                          
                          <h5>Ulcers:</h5>
                          <p>The banana is used as the dietary food against intestinal disorders because of its soft texture & smoothness. It is the only raw fruit that can be eaten without distress in over-chronicler cases. It also neutralizes over-acidity & reduces irritation by coating the lining of the stomach.</p>

                        	  <h5>Temperature control:</h5>
                          <p>Many other cultures see bananas as a "cooling" fruit that can lower both the physical & emotional temperature of expectant mothers. In Thailand, for example, pregnant women eat bananas to ensure their baby is born with a cool temperature.</p>
                          <h5>Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD):</h5>
                          <p>Bananas can help SAD sufferers because they contain the natural mood enhancer tryptophan.</p>
                          
                          <h5>Smoking &Tobacco Use:</h5>
                          <p>Bananas can also help people trying to give up smoking. The B6, B12 they contain, as well as the potassium & magnesium found in them, help the body recover from the effects of nicotine withdrawal.</p>
                          
                          <h5>Stress:</h5>
                          <p>Potassium is a vital mineral, which helps normalize the heartbeat, sends oxygen to the brain & regulates your body's water balance. When we are stressed, our metabolic rate rises, thereby reducing our potassium levels. These can be rebalanced with the help of a high-potassium banana snack.</p>
                          
                           <h5>Strokes:</h5>
                          <p>According to research in The New England Journal of Medicine, eating bananas as part of a regular diet can cut the risk of death by strokes by as much as 40%!</p>
                          
                          <h5>Warts:</h5>
                          <p>Those keen on natural alternatives swear that if you want to kill off a wart, take a piece of banana skin & place it on the wart, with the yellow side out. Carefully hold the skin in place with a plaster or surgical tape!
<br>
So, a banana really is a natural remedy for many ills. When you compare it to an apple, it has four times the protein, twice the carbohydrate, three times the phosphorus, five times the vitamin A & iron, & twice the other vitamins & minerals. It is also rich in potassium & is one of the best value foods around. So maybe it’s time to change that well-known phrase so that we say, "A banana a day keeps the doctor away!"

                            <p>Called banadoora in Lebanon, outa and tamatem in Egypt, Pomme d’or in France; many pretty names for tomatoes.</p>
                            <p>Red in color, silky smooth to the touch, tasty flavor that invites lookers to touch and taste, loved by old and young, and ranks first in most recipes, tomatoes were first found in America (the new world), then were transported to Europe. Many consider them vegetables and many others consider them fruits... they can be eaten raw and have a juice similar to fruit juices. They are the main ingredient in most salads.</p>
                            <p>Tomatoes contain nitrogenous substances, fat, carbohydrates, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, high amounts of vitamins such as: vitamin A, B, C and K. adding to that, they contain some minerals such as: iron, copper, calcium, potassium, phosphorus and sulfur.</p>
                            <p>It has a high nutritional value if eaten fresh; every 200 grams provide 40 calories so it is considered a great food for people, who are following a weight reducing diet.</p>

                            <p>Is there such a thing as White Tea? If so, is there something about it that requires my attention? Why should I devote my time to learn about it? These are the more important questions you might probably ask; and the answers are right here:</p>
                            <p>Until recently, White Tea was relatively unknown outside the Chinese culture. While Chinese Tea drinkers have been hip to the spectacular benefits of White Tea, little or nothing at all has been done outside Asia to harness the goodness of this gift of nature.</p>
                            <p>What most tea drinkers only know is that all tea comes from the same source: the Camilla Sinensis tea bush. BLACK TEA derives its dark color and full flavor from a complex fermentation process; while GREEN TEA is almost not fermented at all to give a more mellow taste. OOLONG TEA falls somewhere in the middle with a little fermentation for a distinct reddish color and flowery flavor.</p>
                            <p>WHITE TEA? White tea is made from the immature tealeaves that are picked shortly before the buds have fully opened. The tea takes its name from the silver hairs covering the buds, which turns white when the tea is dried.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4">
                            <p>The heavenly secret lies in what happens after the buds are plucked. Tealeaves destined to be sold as WHITE TEA undergo even less processing than green tea leaves. Instead of air-drying, the leaves are merely steamed. The result? A pale tea with a sweet, silky, smooth flavor. None of the GRASSY aftertaste usually found on Green Tea.</p>
                            <p>White Tea extract induces lipolytic activity and inhibits adipogenesis in human subcutaneous (pre)-adipocytes (Jörn Söhle et al. Nutrition & Metabolism 2009, 6:20)</p>
                            <p>White Tea extract and their respective bioactive components, such as polyphenols and methylxanthines, might have direct effects on adipose tissue. This extract is a natural source that effectively inhibits adipogenesis and stimulates lipolysis-activity. Therefore, it can be utilized to modulate different levels of the adipocyte life cycle.</p>
