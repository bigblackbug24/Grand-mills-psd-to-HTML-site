                                <p>The following are general tips to help you create fantastic meals every time.  Ingredients. It is impossible to create a great dish by using poor ingredients.  </p>
                                <p>Always make sure that the food that you buy is of good quality; Perishables such as fruit, vegetables, dairy, meat and fish must be fresh at time of purchase and once home stored correctly. </p>
                                <p>Remember to check the expiry date on non-perishables as well, and store according to instructions.  </p>
                                <p>Preparation. It is important to use reliable recipes to ensure good results. Accurate measurements are important, especially when baking so make sure that you have a reliable set of kitchen scales, measuring cups and spoons. When it comes to cooking, as with most things, “practice makes perfect.” </p>
                            </ul>

                               <li><p>Cooking. It is important that you “get to know” your oven as some ovens seem to cook more efficiently than others. Read the instruction manual to find the best rack position and function for baking, roasting, grilling etc. If you are unsure on the accuracy of your oven, invest in a thermometer that attaches to the rack, for peace of mind. Most chefs use a probe type thermometer to ensure that meat is cooked perfectly.

                               <li><p>Presentation. The final presentation of the food to your family or guests is the culmination of all your hard work:</p></li>
                               <li><p>Plates.Choose the correct type of plate to match your food with regard to size, shape, colour and pattern. E.g. a desert should not be served in a soup bowl. Ensure that the colour or pattern does not detract from the food and the type of crockery matches the style of food -e.g. fine china for fine dining, chunkier crockery for more casual dining.</p></li>
                               <li><p>Temperature.Ensure that your food reaches the table at the correct temperature, warm the plates beforehand if necessary.</p></li>
                               
                               <li><p>Garnish.Garnishes should be used to enhance the appearance of your dish, not overwhelm it. If using herbs, make sure they are fresh. Wash and sort beforehand and store them in the fridge, in a sealed container lined with kitchen towel, on crushed ice. Make sure that any garnish that you do use is relevant to the dish.</p></li>
                               
                               <li><p>Appearance.Consider colour and textural combinations of the food you are serving to make sure they are appetizing. </p></li>
                               
                               <li><p>Final Check. Always wipe any spills and dribbles off the side of the plate before it is taken to the table.   </p></li>

                                <p>Chew your food well: chewing your food increases the release of the cancer fighting chemicals found in foods such as broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower.</p>
                                <p>Walk daily: half an hour daily walks decreases the incidence of cancer by 18%, decreases the risk for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, and helps in losing approximately 3 kg per year.</p>
                                <p>Eat almonds: eating almonds between meals and whenever you feel hungry provides you with essential elements and nutrients that your diet might lack.</p>
                                <p>Don’t be in a hurry all the time: you may want to consider taking your time while doing your daily chores to prevent hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases.</p>
                                <p>Chew gum between meals: it is recommended to chew sugar free gum for half an hour after you eat your meals to clean your teeth and decrease heartburn.</p>
                                <p>6-10 exchanges of fruits and vegetables a day: you may decrease the risk of heart attacks by 70%, if you consumed 3-5 exchanges of each of the fruits and vegetables groups.</p>
                                <p>Replace sugar with honey: using honey to sweeten your tea, coffee or milk, may increase your immunity and works as a germicide.</p>
                                <p>Choose you’re the proper sunglasses: sunglasses should protect your eyes from the dangers of UV rays, which might cause iris damages that could lead to blindness in later days. Make sure to choose the highest UV protection in your sunglasses.</p>
                                <p>Monitor the mole on your skin: studies have shown that monitoring moles increases the chance of spotting any changes in them and decreases the risk of skin cancer by 13%.</p>
                                <p>Clean teeth: don’t wet your toothbrush before using toothpaste on it; dry toothbrushes have the chance of removing plaque by 67% more than wet ones.</p>
                           <p>Good night sleep: consume apples to fight insomnia and sleep well, which might reduce geriatric problems and keep your complexion young and healthy.</p>
                           <p>Consume whole wheat bread instead of white bread: whole wheat bread has a higher content of fiber that reduces the feeling of hunger and increases satiety and helps manage blood sugar.</p>
                           <p>Drink green tea: it is recommended to drink one cup of green tea per day to reduce cell oxidation in the body that protects against cancers.</p>
                           <p>Eat fish at least once a week: nutritionists recommend two exchanges of fish a week, which help with maintaining a healthy chemical balance in the brain. In addition, fish contains nutrients that help protect the heart and the brain.</p>

                           <p>15. Stop biting your nails: this bad habit renders your nails and hands ugly and unhealthy looking. Further, it causes small cracks in your teeth that leads to dental caries, gum ulcerations, and inflammations.</p>
                           <p>Consume a lot of herbs: consuming herbs between meals helps your digestion and rids the body from toxic substances.</p>
                           <p>Enjoy your weekends: take advantage of your days off to program a relaxing time after the effort you put in your work all week long.</p>
                           <p>Eat two pieces of chocolate every day: specialists have established that chocolate prevents anemia and improves the mood.</p>
                           <p>Don’t carry heavy loads: heavy loads affect your spine, posture, and your walk negatively.</p>
                           <p>What color is your tongue: the color of your tongue is a good sign of your health status. White tongue might mean low immunity, yellow might mean overeating, and red tongue tip might mean mental stress.</p>
                           <p>Go out and walk outdoors: changing the daily routine by walking outdoors helps your mood and decreases your stress and depression. Visit your friends and family.</p>
                           <p>Clean clothes: you might not be able to see microscopic germs on your clothes, so changing into clean ones might decrease the probability of infections and diseases, especially on hot weather day.</p>
                           <p>Don’t eat quickly: People who eat quickly and until they''''re full are three times more likely to be overweight than others, a Japanese study says.</p>
                           <p>Consume antioxidants rich foods: consume a lot of fruits and vegetables in abundance for their content of vitamins E and C, ß-carotenes, and flavonoids, which function as antioxidants and prevent genetic mutation of the cell. This protects against cancers.</p>
                           <p>Moderation in consuming certain foods: these include salted, pickled, smoked, barbequed, and processed foods, which may contain some carcinogens.</p>
                           <p>Calcium and vitamin D vs. Protein: Adequate calcium and vitamin D are essential for optimal bone health. However, a high-protein diet is beneficial to bone, particularly when calcium and vitamin D intake are limited. High protein diets are associated with decreased bone loss and fractures.</p>
                           <p>Exercise to Gain Weight: exercise is important for good health and the right type of exercise can help you gain muscle, which will give you more body mass. Weight-lifting exercises that are designed to build muscle should be included with your weight-gaining diet and perhaps aerobic exercise should be cut back a bit. For more on exercise to gain muscle, read How to Build Muscle.</p>
