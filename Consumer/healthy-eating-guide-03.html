It is added to many foods and beverages to improve their smell and taste; in addition it is often used by the lady of the house, especially in the kitchen with the Jordanian stuffed cabbage and eggplant to make them tastier and to prevent flatulence and fullness, which may result from digesting such foods. Food vendors, who sell chickpeas and beans, often add it to the beans for the purpose of improving the taste and preventing flatulence, which may result from eating legumes.</p>				
                            <p>Cumin was described by the ancient Egyptians and called the “Tien”. They used it as a pharmaceutical against many diseases.</p>

        				<h5>Important notes for the use of cumin:</h5>
                        <p>It is necessary to purchase cumin in small quantities and not to purchase large amounts to avoid the loss of the plant for its aromatic and medicinal properties. It is also advised to store these small quantities in closed dark colored containers away from light and high temperatures.
Adding it to salads and different dishes and foods can increase consumption. Cumin powder can also be used as a sneezing powder, if sometimes required in the case of colds and nasal congestion, by putting a small amount of the powder in the hand and inhaling deeply.</p>

                            <p>A single date contains an average amount of 23 calories, which is considered a very low caloric amount.</p>
<p>The very low calorie count and the huge amount of healthy substances in dates make them the best nutrition for a diet plan menu. However, the number of dates incorporated in the diet makes a huge difference in the final total calories consumed. Thus, it would be beneficial to plan your meals and count the number of fruits consumed to avoid over eating.

A salad with sprouts and cherries could work. Here are a number of diseases that can be helped by combining dynamic duos, from Food Synergy: Unleash Hundreds of Powerful Healing Food Combinations to Fight Disease and Live Well.</p>
                            <h5>Broccoli with tomatoes fights prostate cancer.</h5>
                            <p>Pairing these two powerhouse foods could be a match not only made in Italy but in health heaven. In a study led by Dr. Erdman and published in a recent issue of Journal of Nutrition, prostate tumors grew much less in rats that were fed tomato and broccoli powders than in rats who ate diets containing either just one of those powders or cancer-fighting substances that had been isolated from tomatoes or broccoli.</p>
                            <h5>Alfalfa sprouts with cherries lowers cholesterol.</h5>
                            <p>In a preliminary study, researchers in the department of molecular pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Southern California’s School of Pharmacy observed a strong antioxidant synergy between alfalfa and acerola cherry extracts that may help reduce oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. It could be the flavonoids from the sprouts working together with vitamin C from the cherries.</p>

                        	<h5>Flaxseed with soybeans fights breast cancer</h5>
                            <p>Previous research has implicated soy as actually having tumor-promoting effects in late-stage breast cancer, but in recent lab studies, flaxseed has been shown to weaken this effect. After another lab study analyzing the breakdown products from the lignans in flaxseed in combination with the primary isoflavone in soy genistein), flaxseed researcher Lilian Thompson, PHD, from the University of Toronto, concluded that for postmenopausal women with low estrogen levels, the combination of soy and flaxseed may be more beneficial than soy alone in controlling breast cancer growth. In this case, the two are better than one!</p>
                            <h5>Tofu with tea tames tumors</h5>
                            <p>People in Asian countries tend to eat soy products and drink tea on a regular basis. Certain types of cancer, including prostate and breast cancer, are significantly lower in the Asian population than in the United States, which begs the question: Is there some anticancer synergy going on between those two Asian staples? Fascinating research with green tea and black suggesting there is a link.</p>
                            <h5>Garlic with onions improves heart health.</h5>
                            <p>Organosulfur compounds are the primary active phytochemicals in garlic and onions, and several of them may protect the heart by helping to keep arteries flexible and clear of plaque damage. For example, DADS (diallyl disulfide) has been shown to possess the strongest antioxidant activity that can prevent oxidation of LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream; another compound, SEC (sethylcysteine), has demonstrated great antiglycation activity. Glycation occurs when sugar molecules attach to proteins and other structures, rendering them nonfunctional; the entire process eventually damages the internalining of blood vessels, causing them to stiffen. Having antiglycation properties, therefore, is definitely a great thing, particularly for people with diabetes who tend to form more advanced glycation compounds.

                            <p>It is found that a mixture of honey and cinnamon cures most Diseases. Honey is produced in most of the countries of the world. Scientists of today also accept honey as a "Ram Ban" (very effective) medicine for all kinds of diseases. Honey can be used without any side Effects for any kind of diseases. 
Today's science says that even though honey is sweet, if taken in the right dosage as a medicine, it does not harm diabetic patients. Weekly World News, a Magazine in Canada, on its issue dated 17 January 1995 has given the following list of diseases that can be cured by honey and cinnamon as researched by western scientists:
</p>
						<h5>HEART DISEASES:</h5>
                        <p>Make a paste of honey and cinnamon powder, apply on bread, instead of jelly and jam, and eat it regularly for breakfast. It reduces the cholesterol in the arteries and saves the patient from a heart attack. Also, those who have already had an attack, if they do this process daily they are kept miles away from the next attack. Regular use of the above process relieves shortness of breath and strengthens the heartbeat. In America and Canada, various nursing homes have treated patients with this mixture successfully and have found that as you age, the arteries and veins lose their flexibility and get clogged; honey and cinnamon revitalize the arteries and veins</p>
                        
                        <h5>ARTHRITIS:</h5>
                        <p>Arthritis patients may take daily morning and night, one cup of hot water with two spoons of honey and one small teaspoon of cinnamon powder. If taken regularly, even chronic arthritis can be cured. In a recent research conducted at the Copenhagen University, it was found that when the doctors treated their patients with a mixture of one tablespoon honey and half teaspoon Cinnamon powder before breakfast, They found that within a week, out of the 200 people so treated, practically 73 patients were totally relieved of pain, and within a month, most of all the patients who could not walk or move around because of arthritis started walking without pain.</p>
                        
                        <h5>BLADDER INFECTIONS: </h5>
                        <p>Take two tablespoons of cinnamon powder and one teaspoon of honey in a glass of lukewarm water and drink it. It destroys the germs in the bladder.</p>
                        
                        <h5>TOOTHACHE:</h5>
                        <p>Make a paste of one teaspoon of cinnamon powder and five teaspoons of honey and apply on the aching tooth. This may be applied three times a day until the tooth stops aching </p>
                        
                        <h5>CHOLESTEROL:</h5>
                        <p>Two tablespoons of honey and three teaspoons of cinnamon powder mixed in 16 ounces of tea water, given to a cholesterol patient were found to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood by 10 percent within two hours. As mentioned for arthritic patients, if taken three times a day, any chronic high cholesterol level is cured. According to information received in the said Journal, pure honey taken with food daily relieves complaints of cholesterol. By the way, if you're taking cholesterol medicine, STOP! They all contain STATIN that weakens your muscles...including YOUR HEART and none has been shown to stop heart attacks or strokes!!!!</p>
                        
                         <h5>COLDS:</h5>
                        <p>Those suffering from common or severe colds should take one tablespoon lukewarm honey with 1/4 spoon cinnamon powder daily for three days. This process will cure most chronic cough, cold, and clear the sinuses.</p>
                        
                         <h5>UPSET STOMACH:</h5>
                        <p>Honey taken with cinnamon powder cures stomach ache and also clears stomach ulcers from the root.</p>

                        <p>According to the studies done in India and Japan, it is revealed that if honey is taken with cinnamon powder the stomach is relieved of gas.</p>
                            
                        	 <h5>IMMUNE SYSTEM: </h5>
                        <p>Daily use of honey and cinnamon powder strengthens the immune system and protects the body from bacterial and viral attacks. Scientists have found that honey has various vitamins and iron in large amounts. Constant Use of honey strengthens the white blood corpuscles to fight bacterial and viral diseases.</p>
                        
                        <h5>INDIGESTION:</h5>
                        <p>Cinnamon powder sprinkled on two tablespoons of honey taken before food relieves acidity and digests the heaviest of meals.</p>
                        
                         <h5>INFLUENZA:</h5>
                        <p>A scientist in Spain has proved that honey contains a natural ingredient, which kills the influenza germs and Saves the patient from flu.</p>
                        
                          <h5>LONGEVITY:</h5>
                        <p>Tea made with honey and cinnamon powder, when taken regularly, arrests the ravages of old age. Take four spoons of honey, one spoon of cinnamon powder and three cups of water and boil to make like tea. Drink 1/4 cup, three to four times a day. It keeps the skin fresh and soft and arrests old age. Life spans also increases and even a 100 year old, starts performing the chores of a 20-year-old</p>
                        
                         <h5>PIMPLES:</h5>
                        <p>Three tablespoons of honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon powder paste. Apply this paste on the pimples before sleeping and wash it next morning with warm water. If done daily for two weeks, it removes pimples from the root.</p>
                        
                        <h5>SKIN INFECTION:</h5>
                        <p>Applying honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts on the affected parts, cures eczema, ringworm and all types of skin infections.</p>
                        
                         <h5>WEIGHT LOSS:</h5>
                        <p>Daily in the morning one half hour before breakfast on an empty stomach and at night before sleeping, drink honey and cinnamon powder boiled in one cup of water. If taken regularly, it reduces the weight of even the most obese person. Also, drinking this mixture regularly does not allow the fat to accumulate in the body even though the person may eat a high calorie diet.</p>
                        <h5>CANCER:</h5>
                        <p>Recent research in Japan and Australia has revealed that advanced cancer of the stomach and bones have been cured successfully. Patients suffering from these kinds of cancer should daily take one tablespoon of honey with one teaspoon of cinnamon powder for one month three times a day.</p>
                        
                         <h5>FATIGUE:</h5>
                        <p>Recent studies have shown that the sugar content of honey is more helpful rather than being detrimental to the strength of the body. Senior citizens, who take honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts, are more alert and flexible. Dr. Milton, who has done research, says that a half-tablespoon of honey taken in a glass of water and sprinkled with cinnamon powder, taken daily after brushing and in the afternoon at about 3:00 p.m. when the vitality of the body starts to decrease, increases the vitality of the body within a week. </p>

                            <p>A diet rich in vitamin, minerals and fatty acids can help reduce aggression, improve mood and prevent depression. So why aren’t more people taking omega-3 capsules?</p>
                            
                            <p>The relationship between nutrition and aggression is a case in point. In 2002, Bernard Gesch, a physiologist at Oxford University, investigated the effects of nutritional supplements on inmates in British prisons. Working with 231 detainees for four months, Gesch gave half the group of men, ages 18 to 21, multivitamin, mineral and fatty-acid supplements with meals. The other half received placebos. During the study, Gesch observed that minor infractions of prison rules fell by 26 percent among men given the supplements, while rule-breaking behaviour in the placebo group barely budged. The research showed more dramatic results for aggressive behavior. Incidents of violence among the group taking supplements dropped 37 percent, while the behavior of the other prisoners did not change.</p>
                            <p>The effect of nutrition on psychological health and behavior is still controversial, at least in part because it is so hard to study. Our moods, emotions and actions are influenced by so many factors: everything from our genes to our communities to our personal relationships.</p>
                            <p>Alex Richardson, a physiologist at Oxford University, conducted a study at 12 local primary schools, writes in They Are What You Feed Them: “There is always something that can be done. Don’t ever believe it if anyone tells you otherwise.” One of the things that can be done, according to Richardson, is to boost your child’s intake of omega-3. Of course, Omega-3 is not the only answer to ADHD, autism, dyslexia, dyspraxia or other psychological or behavioral disorders, which also include Alzheimer’s disease. Studies like Richardson’s suggest, however, that it may play an important role in stimulating the brain, keeping it healthy and helping it ward off debilitating conditions.</p>

                           <p>And it looks like we need all the help we can get. Behavioral dysfunctions like ADHD are currently the fastest-growing type of disorder worldwide. Twenty years ago, no one had even heard of ADHD. Today, everyone knows a kid who is taking Ritalin. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the number of people with psychological disorders will double by 2020–and that around that time, depression will surpass heart and vascular disease as the No. 1 most preventable cause of death. The WHO adds that psychological disorders account for four of the 10 most common causes of disability and that they will affect a quarter of the general population at some point in their lives.</p>
                           
                           <p>WHO adds that psychological disorders account for four of the 10 most common causes of disability and that they will affect a quarter of the general population at some point in their lives. Diet could well play a central role in all this. The quality–and quantity–of the food we eat has increased dramatically over the past century or so. But we are eating more and more processed foods, which contain less and less of the essential minerals, vitamins and fatty acids that appear to be so crucial for mental health. Tomato juice, for example, contains 64 percent less vitamin C, 49 percent less carotene and 17 percent less niacin than a fresh tomato.</p>
                           
                           
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4">
                            <p>Gesch says we “seem to have made unprecedented changes to human diets in recent years with little or no systematic evaluation of the effects on our brain or behavior.” He wants to reverse “high-calorie malnutrition” by encouraging nutritionists, physicians and educators to concentrate not just on calorie intake but on the consumption of nutritional components like vitamins, minerals and fatty acids as well</p>
                           
                           <p>In our distant evolutionary past, we all had much more varied diets. Research among native tribes in remote areas suggests that our hunter-gatherer forebears consumed between 100 and 150 different types of plants during the course of a year. Nowadays, our grain consumption is heavily dominated by wheat. Soy oil accounts for more than 80 percent of the fat Americans consume. Health authorities recommend a minimum of 400 grams (14 ounces) of vegetables and fruit each day, but lots of people don’t even come close to that. And even those who do eat lots of fruit and vegetables often don’t get the full nutritional benefit because intensive farming has depleted the soil of key minerals.</p>
                           
                           <p>So what’s a consumer to do? Eat fish. Working with the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), American physician and psychiatrist Joseph Hibbeln compared data on fish consumption with figures on depression and murder in a large number of countries around the world. Fish are a rich and ready source of omega-3. In countries in which fish consumption is low, Hibbeln found the likelihood of suffering from depression was up to 50 times greater than in countries where it is high.</p>
                           <p>Hibbeln also found that, on average, the risk of being murdered is 30 times greater in countries where fish consumption is low compared to countries where it is high. Cultural and other factors certainly influence these statistics, but the comparisons are nevertheless illustrative. Overall, in subsequent trials, Hibbeln found that depressive and aggressive feelings diminished by about 50 percent after taking fish-oil capsules for two to four weeks. Based on this and other research, the WHO concluded in a report last year: "Certain dietary choices, including fish consumption, balanced intake of micronutrients and a good nutritional status overall, also have been associated with reduced rates of violent behavior."</p>
                           
                           <p>Although more and more research underlines the importance of nutrition for psychological wellness, these findings have not been widely translated into action. </p>
                           
                           <p>A multivitamin and mineral supplement is a good “insurance policy,” Richardson says, and 500 mg of omega-3 every day is not a bad idea either. But buyers beware: Not all supplements are good supplements, so seek the advice of a qualified professional before deciding which supplement, if any, is right for you.</p>
                           
                           <p>It almost sounds too good to be true, but research is beginning to confirm that vitamins, minerals and fatty acids can reduce aggression and improve psychological well-being. That could be a simple recipe for a more peaceful world.</p>

                            <p>Folic acid supplements reduce the risk of neural tube defects and may be associated with reduced risk for vascular disease and cancer. Research data from both observational and controlled intervention studies provide strong support for the existing public health policies related to folic acid and neural tube defects. However, educational efforts to promote daily intake of folic acid supplements by women of reproductive age have not, in most cases, resulted in increased supplement use. In contrast, food fortification appears to be associated with a reduction in neural tube defects in the United States and Canada but is not practiced universally. The potential for folic acid supplements to reduce the incidence and severity of vascular disease and cancer is the focus of major research efforts including ongoing intervention studies.</p>
