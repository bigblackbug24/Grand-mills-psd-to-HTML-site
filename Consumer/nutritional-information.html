                                        <li>
                                        <p>Eat a dark green vegetable (broccoli, spinach, kale, collard greens) at least three times a week. These nutritional powerhouses are packed full of vitamins such as calcium and iron. On the run or hate spinach? Try drinking your greens. 					</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li><p>Take a vitamin supplement that contains B12 or include nutritional yeast in your diet regularly, especially if you're vegan or mostly vegan.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Water! It's been said over and over again for a reason—because it’s true! Most people don't drink nearly enough. Bring a water bottle with you wherever you go and invest in a simple filter for your home. Water is especially important when adjusting to a new way of eating, as it will help curb any cravings you may experience.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Make it a goal to eat at least one piece of raw fruit or a handful of raw vegetables every day. Try to eat an apple first thing in the morning to get it out of the way.</p></li>

                                        <li><p>Reduce your refined sugar intake. We've got as much of a sweet tooth as anybody, but we try to keep it under control by using such sugar replacers as maple syrup, stevia and agave whenever possible (such as in coffee and tea) and indulging in the refined stuff only occasionally.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Keep your favorite salad dressings on hand. We find that we’re much more likely to eat our greens or some raw veggies when our favorite salad dressings are in the fridge. A little variety is great too.  Try to keep at least two kinds, either store bought or homemade on hand at all times. Some of our favorites are homemade goddess dressing, Thai peanut sauce from my local Asian grocer and raspberry vinaigrette. A vegan ranch dressing was helpful as well when I was trying to wean myself off dairy.</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Eat the rainbow! Fruits and vegetables all contain different nutrients. A simple way to remember to eat a range of vitamins and minerals is to vary the colors of the vegetables you eat. Of course, greens are always good, but try eating a rainbow of tomatoes, yellow squash and purple cabbage!</p></li>

                            <div class="roboto">
                                   <p>Fad diets are bad because they do not address the problems that caused you to gain weight in the first place. If you don't learn something about the foods you eat, you will gain the weight back when you reestablish old eating habits. Fad diets are also bad for you because they frequently require the elimination of perfectly healthy foods. Some fad diets require pills and potions that will make your wallet slimmer but probably not do much for your thighs.</p>
                            <h5>What Is a Fad Diet?</h5>
                            <p>A fad diet is any trendy diet that promises fast and easy weight loss. They are very tempting and the advertisements for the fad diets lure you in with magnificent claims of weight loss. No need to worry about counting calories or exercises, just follow the rules and the extra pounds fall right off. When something sounds too good to be true, it probably isn't, so don't fall for the fad diet hype.</p>
                            <p>How do you know you are looking at a fad diet? There are some typical signs:</p>
                                    <ul class="roboto accordion-power-margin accordion-wheat-margin">
                                        <li><p>Claims of fast and easy weight loss</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Elimination of certain food groups or bad foods</p></li>
                        <li><p>Includes dietary supplements impressively labeled as fat burners and metabolism boosters</p></li>
                        <li><p>Tells you that foods need to be specifically combined for proper digestion to occur</p></li>
                                        <li><p>No need for exercise</p></li>
                         <li><p>Highlights specific foods, such as grapefruit, maple syrup and lemonade or special soup</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                              <p>Fad diets may be effective for weight loss in the short term because you will lose some extra fluid as well as some fat. The weight loss is usually temporary because you're going to return to your old eating habits when you go off the diet. In a few weeks your weight will be right back where it was before the diet.</p>
                            </div>        
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4">
                            <div class="accordion-text roboto">
                               <p>Fad diets may be effective for weight loss in the short term because you will lose some extra fluid as well as some fat. The weight loss is usually temporary because you're going to return to your old eating habits when you go off the diet. In a few weeks your weight will be right back where it was before the diet. 
</p>
                               <p>Some people develop a pattern called "yo-yoing" or weight-cycling, which is losing weight, gaining weight and losing it again and repeating this pattern for many years. Some experts believe that weight cycling is unhealthy. There really isn't any evidence to support this idea, but obviously it isn't as effective as adopting a healthy balanced diet that you can follow for a lifetime.  
</p>
                               <p>Don't fall for the claims of extreme weight-loss "fat-burner" supplements. Take your eyes off the svelte woman (who just lost 30 pounds in a few weeks!) and look down at the bottom of the ad. You will see a disclaimer in tiny letters, "weight-loss not typical, your results may vary." That means people don't lose much weight.  
</p>
                               <p>Some diets require you to eliminate certain food groups with claims that we haven't evolved enough, as a species to eat wheat, or beef and tomatoes doesn’t match your blood type. These are interesting theories, but have very little evidence. Some people do need to eliminate certain foods due to allergies or metabolic disorders such as celiac disease, but most of us need to choose foods from all of the food groups every day. </p>
                               <p>A few fad diets require you to combine certain types of foods stating that your body can't digest carbs with proteins or fats. This is absurd. Your digestive system uses specific enzymes for digestion of different foods and they don't cancel each other out - in fact, they all work quite nicely together. </p>

                                    <p><strong>Myth #1:</strong> Fad diets work for permanent weight loss. </p>           
                                    <p><strong>Fact:</strong>: Fad diets are not the best way to lose weight and keep it off. Fad diets often promise quick weight loss or tell you to cut certain foods out of your diet. You may lose weight at first on one of these diets. But diets that strictly limit calories or food choices are hard to follow. Most people quickly get tired of them and regain any lost weight. Fad diets may be unhealthy because they may not provide all of the nutrients your body needs. Also, losing weight at a very rapid rate (more than 3 pounds a week after the first few weeks) may increase your risk for developing gallstones (clusters of solid material in the gallbladder that can be painful). Diets that provide less than 800 calories per day also could result in heart rhythm abnormalities, which can be fatal. </p>
                                    <p>Research suggests that losing ½ to 2 pounds a week by making healthy food choices, eating moderate portions, and building physical activity into your daily life is the best way to lose weight and keep it off. By adopting healthy eating and physical activity habits, you may also lower your risk for developing: </p>
                                    <ul class="roboto accordion-power-margin accordion-wheat-margin">
                                    	<li><p>Type 2 diabetes</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Heart disease</p></li>
                                        <li><p>High blood pressure</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                     <p><strong>Myth #2:</strong> High-protein/low-carbohydrate diets are a healthy way to lose weight. Fact: The long-term health effects of a high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet are unknown. But getting most of your daily calories from high-protein foods like meat, eggs, and cheese is not a balanced eating plan. You may be eating too much fat and cholesterol, which may raise heart disease risk. You may be eating too few fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which may lead to constipation due to lack of dietary fiber. Following a high-protein/low-carbohydrate diet may also make you feel:</p>
                                     <ul class="roboto accordion-power-margin accordion-wheat-margin">
                                    	<li><p>Nauseous</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Tired</p></li>
                                        <li><p>Weak</p></li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Eating fewer than 130 grams of carbohydrates a day can lead to the buildup of ketones (partially broken-down fats) in your blood. A buildup of ketones in your blood (called ketosis) can cause your body to produce high levels of uric acid, which is a risk factor for gout (a painful swelling of the joints) and kidney stones. Ketosis may be especially risky for pregnant women and people with diabetes or kidney disease.</p>
                                    <p
                                    <p><strong>Tip:</strong>High-protein/low-carbohydrate diets are often low in calories because food choices are strictly limited, so they may cause short-term weight loss. But a reduced-calorie eating plan that includes recommended amounts of carbohydrate, protein, and fat will also allow you to lose weight. By following a balanced eating plan, you will not have to stop eating whole classes of foods, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables—and miss the key nutrients they contain. You may also find it easier to stick with a diet or eating plan that includes a greater variety of foods. </p>
                                  <p><strong>Myth #3</strong>:Starches are fattening and should be limited when trying to lose weight. </p> 
								  <p>Fact: Many foods high in starch, are low in fat and calories such as:</p>
                                  <ul class="roboto accordion-power-margin accordion-wheat-margin">
                                  	<li><p>Bread</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Rice</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Pasta</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Cereals</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Beans</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Fruits</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Some vegetables (like potatoes and yams)</p></li>
                                  </ul>
								<p>They become high in fat and calories when eaten in large portion sizes or when covered with high-fat toppings like butter, sour cream, or mayonnaise. Foods high in starch (also called complex carbohydrates) are an important source of energy for your body. 
</p>
                                <p>Tip: The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends eating 6 to 11 servings a day, depending on your calorie needs, from the bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group—even when trying to lose weight. Pay attention to your serving sizes—one serving is equal to 1 slice of bread, 1 ounce of ready-to-eat cereal, or ½ cup of pasta, rice, or cooked cereal. Try to avoid high-fat toppings and choose whole grains, like: </p>
                                <ul class="roboto accordion-power-margin accordion-wheat-margin">
                                  	<li><p>Whole wheat bread</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Brown rice</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Oatmeal</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Bran cereal</p></li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p>Choose other starchy foods that are high in dietary fiber too, like beans, peas, and vegetables. </p>

                       <p><strong>Myth #4:</strong> Certain foods, like grapefruit, celery, or cabbage soup, can burn fat and make you lose weight. 
</p>
                                  <p><strong>Fact:</strong> No foods can burn fat. Some foods with caffeine may speed up your metabolism (the way your body uses energy, or calories) for a short time, but they do not cause weight loss. Tip: The best way to lose weight is to cut back on the number of calories you eat and be more physically active. </p>
                                  
                                 
                     <p><strong>Myth #5:</strong> Natural or herbal weight loss products are safe and effective. Fact: A weight loss product that claims to be "natural" or "herbal" is not necessarily safe. These products are not usually scientifically tested to prove that they are safe or that they work. For example, herbal products containing ephedra have caused serious health problems and even death. Newer products that claim to be ephedra-free are not necessarily danger-free, because they may contain ingredients similar to ephedra.</p>
                                  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Talk with your health care provider before using any weight loss product. Some natural or herbal weight loss products can be harmful. </p>
                      <p><strong>Myth #6:</strong> "I can lose weight while eating whatever I want." </p>
                                  <p><strong>Fact:</strong> To lose weight, you need to use more calories than you eat. It is possible to eat any kind of food you want and lose weight. You need to limit the number of calories you eat every day and/or increase your daily physical activity. Portion control is the key. Try eating smaller amounts of food and choosing foods that are low in calories. </p>
                                  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> When trying to lose weight, you can still eat your favorite foods, as long as you pay attention to the total number of calories that you eat. </p>
                                  <p><strong>Myth #7:</strong> Low-fat or nonfat means no calories. </p>
                                  <p><strong>Fact:</strong> A low-fat or nonfat food is often lower in calories than the same size portion of the full-fat product. But many processed low-fat or nonfat foods have just as many calories as the full-fat version of the same food or even more calories. They may contain added sugar, flour, or starch thickeners to improve flavor and texture after fat is removed. These ingredients add calories. </p>

                                  <p><strong>Myth #8:</strong> Fast foods are always an unhealthy choice and you should not eat them when dieting</p>
                                  <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Fast foods can be part of a healthy weight loss program with a little bit of know-how. Tip: Avoid supersize combo meals, or split one with a friend. Sip on water or nonfat milk instead of soda. Choose salads and grilled foods, like a grilled chicken breast sandwich or small hamburger. Try a "fresco" taco (with salsa instead of cheese or sauce) at taco stands. Fried foods, like French fries and fried chicken, are high in fat and calories, so order them only once in a while, order a small portion, or split an order with a friend. Also, use only small amounts of high-fat, high-calorie toppings, like: </p>
                                  <ul class="roboto accordion-power-margin accordion-wheat-margin">
                                  	<li><p>Regular mayonnaise</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Salad dressings</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Bacon</p></li>
                                    <li><p>Cheese</p></li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p><strong>Myth #9:</strong> Skipping meals is a good way to lose weight. </p>
                                  <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Studies show that people who skip breakfast and eat fewer times during the day tend to be heavier than people who eat a healthy breakfast and eat four or five times a day. This may be because people who skip meals tend to feel hungrier later on, and eat more than they normally would. It may also be that eating many small meals throughout the day helps people control their appetites. 
</p>
                                  <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Eat small meals throughout the day that include a variety of healthy, low-fat, low-calorie foods. </p>

                            <p>If you suffer from migraines, these debilitating headaches need no introduction. You might feel better, though, knowing that 28 million other Americans-the overwhelming majority of them women-are also searching for something safe to make the pain go away. </p>
                            <p>Scott Greenberg, M.D., a physician at the Magazine Center for Wellness and Anti-Aging Medicine in New Jersey, says the classic migraine begins with an aura-a warning sign such as blurred vision or lines in your visual field-followed by intense pain across your head. It can also occur without any warning at all, however. "Sensitivities to light and noise set in next," Greenberg says. "Then come the nausea, vomiting, and pain." </p>
                            <p>
Migraines can last from two hours to two days, says Greenberg, "with the majority of them passing after six to eight hours." They occur as infrequently as two to three times a year or as often as four to five times per week. </p>
                            <p>Common migraine instigators include foods containing tyramine (like chocolate and aged cheeses), changes in the weather, strong odors, and air pollution. </p>
                            <p>Alternative treatments </p>
                            <p>Most neurologists prescribe betablockers, triptan prescriptions like Imitrex, or nerve injections for this type of headache. But, Greenberg warns, they all come with serious side effects. "Taking triptans brings an increased risk of heart attack or stroke; beta-blockers cause fatigue, weight gain, and insulin sensitivity; and nerve injections only mask the pain." Luckily, many alternative remedies have gained ground in the fight against migraine symptoms. Here are a few natural remedies that may help ease your headache pain. </p>
                            <p>Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) </p>
                            <p>This herb treats migraine pain by interrupting its main cause- inflammatory reactions in your head that aggravate nerve endings and cause the blood vessels to expand. When taken daily, feverfew can prevent migraines, according to Gene Bruno, a nutritionist in New York City, as well as "reduce their severity, duration, and frequency." Be patient. The results can take four to six weeks. But if you stop taking it, your migraines might return.  </p>
                            <p>Dosage:500 to 600 mg of standardized feverfew daily to treat or prevent migraines. Take two equal portions of feverfew on an empty stomach in the morning and evening.

                        <div class="col-md-4">
                           <p><strong>GLA (gamma-linoleic acid)</strong></p>
                           <p>In a study conducted in Berlin, the anti-inflammatory effect of GLA, an Omega 6 essential fatty acid, reduced the severity, frequency, and duration of migraines in 86 percent of the participants. By reducing inflammation in the brain, GLA significantly lessened nausea and vomiting, allowing patients to switch from harsh prescriptions to aspirin and acetaminophen. </p>
                           <p>Dosage: 1,300 to 1,600 mg of GLA from borage oil or evening primrose oil works best. Don't use GLA if you take an anti-seizure prescription. GLA may interact with these medicines. Take it on a full stomach in two divided doses, equally spaced during the day.</p>
                           <h5>Magnesium</h5>
                           <p>A recent Italian study found a strong correlation between migraines and hormonal fluctuations. In fact, 60 percent of the women studied got migraines right before, during, or immediately after their period. Estrogen hormones can block the body's absorption of magnesium, leading to low blood levels of the mineral. </p>
                           <p><strong>Dosage:</strong> "To treat or prevent a migraine, take 200 mg of magnesium twice a day," says Bruno. Take with meals to ensure optimal absorption. </p>
                           <h5>Calcium and vitamin D</h5>
                           <p>A calcium deficiency can exacerbate migraine symptoms, says New York City endocrinologist Susan Thys-Jacobs, M.D. Scientists speculate that women suffer from migraines more often than men because "women are more prone to calcium deficiencies than men," says Thys-Jacobs, a leader in hormonal research. Most women experience low calcium levels during the premenstrual or ovulatory phase of their menstrual cycle. "The hormones that regulate calcium react negatively with high levels of estrogen and progesterone, which causes a deficiency that can trigger migraines," she says. </p>
                           <p><strong>Dosage:</strong> Since vitamin D improves calcium absorption, Thys-Jacobs recommends taking the two supps together. "Take 100 mg of calcium and 1,000 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D on a full stomach."</p>

                            		<h5>Is organic food more nutritious? </h5>  
                                    <p>It is hard to interpret research studies that compare organic food to food grown by other methods. Many factors such as the quality of soil, temperature and light during the growing season, and the type of seeds planted can affect the nutritional content of a food. In most situations, these factors are not controlled so accurate comparisons can't be made. However, some research shows that organic produce may be higher in vitamin C than those grown non-organically. Vitamin A, beta-carotene, and the B vitamins are generally the same, but some phytochemicals (compounds that are neither vitamins nor minerals, but thought to be helpful to health) are higher in organic produce. Therefore, some foods grown organically may have more nutritional value while many have the same as those grown on non-organic farms. The best advice is to eat a variety of vegetables and fruit.</p>
                               <h5>What is different about organic farming and how could that affect nutritional content?</h5> 
                                   <p>For vegetables, fruit and cereal crops, organic farmers use techniques such as green manures and compost to enrich the soil. Green manures are special crops that are planted, grown, and then plowed back into the soil. Organic farmers also use both plant and animal compost to keep the soil fertile. These practices can result in higher nutrient content of the soil, and perhaps of foods grown in the soil. Some non-organic farmers may also use a combination of organic farming techniques such as ‘green manures' as well as non-organic farming techniques such as chemical fertilizers. This further complicates the ability to state that foods grown organically have more nutritional value than conventionally grown food. </p>
                                    <h5>How do I know if foods are organic? </h5>
                                    <p>For many years, the labeling of organic food was voluntary with a number of certification bodies taking responsibility for ensuring standards were met. In June 2009, new mandatory guidelines will be implemented for organic food that is traded across provinces or countries. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency will work in cooperation with certification bodies to ensure that Canada-wide standards are met, and a special logo identifying the food as organic will be used on packaging. </p>

                                <h5>Is organic food as safe as other food?</h5>
                                <p>The key to lowering food safety risks is to operate a well-managed farm, whether it is an organic farm or not. Organic farmers are good managers when they use properly composted animal manures and use preventive measures to protect crops from insects before damage occurs to the plants. Organically grown produce, such as salad greens, have been shown to be equivalent to conventional produce in terms of food safety. Organic foods should be prepared with the same precautions as conventional foods, i.e., fruits and vegetables should be washed prior to preparation and consumption. Rinsing also removes the minimal levels of pesticides typically found on produce. For more information on washing fruits and vegetables, visit http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/concen/specif/fruvege.shtml</p>

                                <p>Sometimes though, extra precautions must be taken, for example, with organic chickens that are not routinely fed antibiotics to prevent bacterial contamination. Salmonella has been found to be higher in some organically grown chickens, but cooking chicken thoroughly and washing kitchen counters well will prevent help prevent salmonella foodborne illness. </p>
                                <h5>Is there an advantage to buying organic food?</h5>
                                <p>Like any purchase, buying organic food should be a personal choice, based on a food's availability, price, appearance and taste, as well as the personal values of the buyer, such as preferring the way that organic foods are grown or raised. While some organic products may give consumers a small advantage, for example, in content of phytochemicals, what's most important is that Canadians choose foods based on Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide.</p>
