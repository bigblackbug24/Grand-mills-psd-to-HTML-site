Some physicians, nutritionists, and researchers have questioned the safety of the low-carb diets.  </p>
                                      <h5>How Low Carb Diets Work</h5>
                                        <p>The basic concept behind the low-carb diet is that carbohydrates promote insulin production, which in turn promotes the accumulation of fat. </p>
                    <p><strong>Summarily, here's how it works:</strong> A lower daily intake of carbohydrates causes the body to burn stored carbohydrates for energy. As this process of burning stored carbohyrates (a.k.a. glycogen) occurs, water is released, and weight loss follows. The body also begins to burn fat for energy. Such a diet is called a "ketogenic" diet because it causes an accumulation of ketones (by-products of fat oxidation) in the bloodstream (which are removed by the kidneys). </p>
                  <p><strong>The theory:</strong> In a state of what has been called perpetual ketosis or benign dietary ketosis, a person loses weight no matter how many calories are consumed from fat and protein.</p>
                  
                  <h5>Long-Term Health Effects </h5>
                  <p>Now that we better understand what a ketogenic diet is - the safety of such a diet comes back into question. The long-term risks and consequences of a low-carb diet are being researched, and no definitive or conclusive evidence yet exists. </p>

                             <p>Compared to national guidelines for nutrition and weight loss, some low-carb diets contain high amounts of saturated fat, animal protein, and cholesterol while lacking nutrients, fiber, and complex carbohydrates considered necessary for maintaining good health. Health experts who express concern over long-term safety suggest some low-carb diets may hike the risk of certain diseases such as:</p>

                                <li><p>Heart disease</p></li>

                                <li><p>Renal disease</p></li>
                                <li><p>Gout</p></li>

                            </ul>
                                <h5>Low Carb Diets & Gout </h5>
                                        <p>Gout is one of the most painful types of arthritis. The suggested correlation between a low-carb diet and an increased risk of gout seems obvious. An excess of uric acid in the body causes gout. A diet comprised of foods rich in purines (i.e. meat, poultry, seafood, nuts, eggs, etc.) are later broken down into uric acid in the body. According to NIH, eating fewer than 130 grams of carbohydrate a day can lead to the buildup of ketones in your blood. Ketosis can also raise uric acid levels.</p>
                                  <h5>Low Carb Diets & Osteoporosis </h5>
                                        <p>Osteoporosis is a condition, which is characterized by loss of the normal density of bone, resulting in brittle bones. Brittle bones are subject to fracture. The disease process can be silent (without symptoms) for decades. There is also a potential increased risk of osteoporosis with a low-carb diet where calcium loss can result if protein intake remains high and calcium intake remains low. The ratio of animal to vegetable protein intake may also contribute to bone loss. </p>
                                   <h5>The Bottom Line </h5>
                                        <p>As is evident by analyzing the prevalence of obesity data, weight loss is a significant issue. However, it is important to realize that not all diets are healthy and some may have serious long-term health consequences. </p>
                                        <p>You should discuss your overall health situation with your doctor before choosing a weight loss plan. Together, with your doctor, you can review your personal medical facts and options, and have a better chance of avoiding adverse effects of a particular weight loss plan. For some, it just may be that the old-fashioned concept of eating less and exercising more is all that is required. </p>

<p>There are many current nutritional terms, claims, and trends, which might interest you. One of the new nutritional terms that is gaining popularity among scientists and consumers at an incredible rate is Phytochemicals. What are phytochemicals? What are they used for? Are they all useful or are some just a common practice that has a historic or a cultural value?
</p>

        <p>To answer some of these questions, let’s start with a definition and advance to what you might find interesting…</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Folk wisdom has long regarded plants for their medicinal and protective qualities. Only recently, though, has science established that plants play a more comprehensive role in the human diet. Phytochemicals, naturally occurring biochemicals that give plants their color, flavor, smell, and texture, may help prevent diseases that are responsible for over 60 percent of all deaths annually in North America.</p>
                                        
                              <h5>Are there any negative effects?</h5>
                    <p>Individual phytochemicals are being evaluated for their safety and effectiveness in regard to disease prevention. Although most studies support positive outcomes, there are a few studies involving animals that show possible detrimental effects. These studies involve animals and specific extracted phytochemicals in high dosages.</p>
                    <p>The safety of consuming large amounts of fruits, vegetables, and grains is not presently a concern. The research question being asked is: "Should one increase the intake of a particular plant food containing phytochemicals, and how much should they increase it?" Obviously, like any other newly discovered chemical, there is a need for further investigation for potential health benefits and possible health risks. </p>
                    <p>Optimal levels of phytochemicals have yet to be determined. In addition, requirements during disease states may differ from requirements for prevention of heart disease and cancer. Individual recommendations in terms of requirements for different genders, age groups, body types, and so forth also need further study.</p>

                                <h5>How can I incorporate more phytochemicalsinto my diet?</h5>
                                        <p>First, it is important for us to become aware of the lack of consumption of fruits, vegetables, and grains. The average American consumes only one serving of vegetables and one serving of fruit each day. In one survey, one in every nine Americans ate no fruit or vegetable on the day they were interviewed.</p>
                                        <p>Increasing the consumption of plant products in one's diet should not be difficult or time consuming. There are plenty of simple strategies for increasing dietary fruits, vegetables, and grains, including the following suggestions:</p>
                                 <ul class="roboto accordion-power-margin accordion-wheat-margin">
                               		<li><p>Keep fruits and vegetables (fresh, frozen, and canned) stocked and in sight.</p></li>
<li><p>Reach for juice instead of coffee or soda. Add chopped fruit to cereal, yogurt, pancakes, muffins, or even a milkshake.</p></li>
  <li><p>Snack on fresh chopped carrots, celery, broccoli, cauliflower, and peppers (purchase at a salad bar to save time).</p></li>
                         <li><p>Add fresh greens, carrots, celery, parsley, tomatoes, and/or beans to your soups.</p></li>
                       <li><p>Store dried fruit (apricots, dates, raisins, and more) for a quick snack at home or work.</p></li>
                              <p>There are also several other easy methods for increasing fruits, vegetables, and grains in your lifestyle. Why not challenge yourself and create one of your own?</p>

<p><strong>Addiction:</strong> Nicotine is a substance as addictive as heroin and has a powerful impact on brain function.</p>

<p><strong>Wrinkles:</strong> Smoking reduces the amount of blood flowing in the skin, which reduces its vitality and elasticity and lead to the occurrence of wrinkles.</p>
                        
<p><strong>Cataracts:</strong> The more a person smokes the more likely they develop cataracts, which may lead to blindness. </p>

<p><strong>Oral cancer:</strong> Smoking causes cancer, types that affect all parts of the mouth. Smoking also impedes the function of saliva in the removal of bacteria from the mouth, and causes a foul smell and distorts the teeth and causes gum disease .</p>

<p><strong>Skin damage:</strong> Tar stains the fingers and nails with yellow color.</p>

<p><strong>Psoriasis:</strong> Smokers get psoriasis twice as often as non-smokers.</p>

<p><strong>Heart disease:</strong> Smoking causes fatal myocardial infarction. It also causes hardening of the arteries, high blood pressure, and heart enlargement.</p>

<p><strong>Lung disease:</strong> Smoking is a major cause of lung cancer. It also causes asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p> 

<p><strong>Stomach ulcers:</strong> Smoking causes stomach ulcers and slows its recovery. It also may cause chronic intestinal diseases.</p>

                          <p>It may seem hard to believe that snacking can strengthen your energy and vitality, but it’s true. By choosing to eat something healthy every few hours you are helping to regulate your blood sugar levels and control cravings. Blood sugar roller coasters are linked to mood swings, anxiety, reduced mental alertness, depression, weight gain, fatigue, and many other symptoms. So, to feel your best, it’s important to snack. </p>
                          
                          <p>Of course, I’m not suggesting you grab the nearest candy bar or bag of chips. Choose healthy snacks between meals and you’ll go a long way toward stronger life force energy. Munch on celery sticks with almond butter, eat veggies with hummus, or grab a piece of fruit, a handful of raw, unsalted nuts. Or, snack on a piece of 100% whole grain spelt bread (you can refer to the recipe for Quick Spelt Bread in my book, The Life Force Diet) with coconut oil spread on top. There are so many great snack options that sometimes all it takes is a little creativity to find the ones that suit you best.</p>

                            <p>I try to carry a small bag of raw, unsalted almonds with me. As delicious as they are nutritious, almonds are packed with magnesium, calcium, protein, and fiber. Eaten as a snack throughout the day, they help to stabilize blood sugar levels, encourage fat loss in overweight individuals, increase energy and balance moods. Because they are an excellent source of magnesium and calcium—nature’s relaxation and mood-boosting nutrients, they are the perfect anti-stress food when eaten on a regular basis. </p>
                            
        <p>If you’re traveling or heading to work, be sure to carry some snacks with you. You’ll be far more likely to eat healthy snacks if they are readily available. By snacking between meals, you’ll balance your blood sugar, which in turn helps to balance your energy levels, moods, and speed weight loss if you’re overweight. Healthy snacking is a worthwhile habit.</p>
