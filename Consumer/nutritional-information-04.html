<p>January 29, 2009 — Consumption of soy foods is associated with a lower risk for colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women, according to the results of a prospective study reported in the February issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. "Soy and some of its constituents, such as isoflavones, have been shown to have cancer-inhibitory activities in experimental studies," write Gong Yang, from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tennessee, and colleagues. "Data from epidemiologic studies linking usual soy food intake with colorectal cancer are limited and inconsistent."</p>
                                        
<p>The goal of this study was to evaluate whether intake of soy food is associated with a risk for colorectal cancer. The study cohort consisted of 68,412 women aged 40 to 70 years and without cancer or diabetes at enrollment. In-person interviews using a validated food-frequency questionnaire evaluated usual soy food intake at baseline (1997-2000) and during the first follow-up (2000-2002). To minimize lifestyle changes related to preclinical disease, the first year of observation was excluded.</p>

<p>There were 321 incident cases of colorectal cancer identified during a mean follow-up of 6.4 years. Total soy food intake was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk, after adjusting for potentially confounding variables. For each 5-g/day increment in dietary intake of soy as measured by dry weight (equivalent to approximately 1 oz [28.35 g] tofu/day), there was an 8% reduction in risk (95% confidence interval [CI), 3% - 14%).</p>

<p>Compared with women in the lowest tertile of soy intake, those in the highest tertile had a multivariate relative risk (RR) of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.49 - 0.90; P for trend = .008). This inverse association was primarily confined to postmenopausal women. Findings were similar for soy protein and isoflavone intakes.</p>

<p>Limitations of this study include possible measurement error in assessing soy food intake.</p>

<p>"This prospective study suggests that consumption of soy foods may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women," the study authors write. "Given the fact that colorectal cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide and that soy can be readily incorporated into most diets, our findings have important public health implications in the prevention of this common malignancy."</p>

                            <p>The results of a study conducted in 2008 showed that the ingestion of one, 250mL can of sugar-free Red Bull, in a sample of 30 healthy young adults, had an immediate detrimental effect on both endothelial function, and normal blood coagulation.

<p>A June 21st, 2009 article published in the “Toronto Sun” newspaper stated the following: BERLIN — Six German states have told retailers to stop selling Red Bull Cola energy drinks after a test found a trace amount of cocaine.
</p>
                            
<p>The bans started Friday after a sample test conducted by authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia state found 0.4 micrograms per litre in the drink.</p>
<p>Five other states also banned it from shops amid concerns over possible narcotics law violations. Germany’s Federal Institute for Risk Assessment said Monday that the cocaine level was too low to pose a health risk. It planned to produce a more detailed report Wednesday.</p>
<p>Red Bull said its cola is “harmless and marketable in both the U.S. and Europe.” It said similar coca leaf extracts are used worldwide as flavouring, and a test it commissioned itself found no cocaine traces.</p>

<p>People who live in this region of the Mediterranean tend to eat a diet high in fat, but they also have a much lower incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer than people in other parts of the world. This is unusual, since most high-fat diets are correlated with a higher incidence of disease and death. This difference could be due to the use of olive oil rather than other types of fats. Olive oil is a monounsaturated fat that keeps your arteries healthy.</p>

<p>More than likely, though, the difference is due to the whole diet, not just the olive oil. The Mediterranean diet is also very high in fiber and antioxidants from vegetables, legumes and nuts -- much higher than the typical Western diet -- and low in saturated fat. Very little red meat is eaten in this region and milk consumption is limited as well, except for some cheese and yogurt.</p>

                            <div class="roboto">
                                <p>More than one third of the population of the United States is considered obese. In 1998, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute published guidelines on the identification, evaluation, and treatment of overweight and obese adults. In spite of these guidelines, healthcare providers still fail to diagnose and treat obesity. The result is a growing epidemic of obese patients, some with weight gain so extensive that it imperils life, and more vigorous methods must be utilized to treat it.
</p>

<p>During 2003-2004, extreme obesity or body mass index (BMI) > 40 kg/m2 characterized approximately 15 million Americans. Obesity has been linked to numerous chronic health conditions including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Obesity-associated conditions significantly increase hospital length of stay and overall healthcare costs and markedly decrease life expectancy. One study found that after age 70 years, Medicare spends 35% more on obese patients than on their normal-weight counterparts.[1] Furthermore, the many adverse psychosocial aspects of obesity include alterations in well-being, reduced quality of life, lower incomes, and social stigmatization.</p>

<p>A leading cause of preventable death, obesity needs to be treated as a chronic health condition by primary care providers. Despite a large increase in the use of bariatric surgery, the number of surgeries performed is still dismal compared with the number of morbidly obese patients. Millions of Americans meet the weight criteria for bariatric surgery, yet few actually undergo it. In 2006, an estimated 180,000 bariatric surgeries were performed in the United States, indicating that less than 1.5% of patients who qualified for bariatric surgery actually had surgery. Many factors, such as patient and provider attitudes regarding obesity and bariatric surgery, cost, and lack of insurance coverage, contribute to the low use of bariatric surgery as a method for weight loss. A synopsis of the literature shows mixed attitudes toward bariatric surgery. Patients often perceive bariatric surgery to be a dangerous and extreme measure.[2] The overall attitude of patients and providers toward bariatric surgery is inconsistent with research showing its use, efficacy, and safety.</p>

<p>Bariatric surgical procedures include restrictive, malabsorptive, and combination techniques. The most commonly performed bariatric surgery in the United States is the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, a combination restrictive and malabsorptive procedure. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is the most commonly performed purely restrictive procedure. Vertical-banded gastroplasty is another restrictive procedure. Purely malabsorptive procedures are less commonly used and include the biliopancreatic diversion.</p>

                            <div class="roboto">
                                <p>A 2005 meta-analysis by Maggard and colleagues[3] reviewed the safety and efficacy of bariatric surgery in 147 studies. This meta-analysis found bariatric surgery to be more effective than nonsurgical weight loss treatments for patients with a BMI of 40 kg/m2, resulting in a 20- to 30-kg weight loss that is maintained for up to 10 years. Similar findings regarding patients with BMIs of 35 to 39.9 kg/m2 were evident but could not be considered conclusive. The study also found that bariatric procedures currently in use have a mortality of less than 1%. A Cochrane Collaboration systematic review of 26 studies indicated that bariatric surgery "results in greater weight loss than conventional treatment, and that the results are maintained at least up to 8 years." In addition, patients had improvements in quality of life, diabetes, and hypertension. Patients were at increased risk of gall bladder disease, heartburn, vomiting, wound infection, and death.[4]
</p>
							<h5>Viewpoint</h5>
<p>In conclusion, recognition of obesity and the associated health consequences, along with initiating patient discussion regarding evidence-based management options, is a responsibility that nurse practitioners must be prepared to address to a greater degree than in the past.</p>

<p>Using bariatric surgery to treat the most morbidly obese patients should result in greater quality of life and decreased healthcare costs for patients and for the healthcare system. However, this surgery is not benign. These patients do experience the same risks as anyone undergoing surgery, but the bariatric surgery seems relatively safe for patients who would ordinarily be considered high risk, and the low mortality rate should be reassuring.</p>

                          <p>People often point to some food item and ask me, "Can you eat this?" My answer is always "Sure, I can eat whatever I want." I choose not to eat certain things. When deciding what type of vegetarian you want to be, think about what you want to include or avoid. You don’t need to fit into one of these categories, but understanding them will help you think about your short-term and long-term goals.</p>
                          
                   <p>Pescatarian (also spelled pescetarian) The word "pescatarian" is occasionally used to describe those who abstain from eating all meat and animal flesh with the exception of fish. Although the word is not commonly used, more and more people are adopting this kind of diet, usually for health reasons or as a stepping stone to a fully vegetarian diet.</p>
                   
                   <h5>Flexitarian/Semi-vegetarian</h5>
                          
                   <p>You don’t have to be vegetarian to love vegetarian food! "Flexitarian" is a term recently coined to describe those who eat a mostly vegetarian diet, but occasionally eat meat.</p>
                   
                   <h5>Vegetarian (Lacto-ovo- vegetarian)</h5>
 
                          <p>When most people think of vegetarians, they think of lacto-ovo-vegetarians. People who do not eat beef, pork, poultry, fish, shellfish or animal flesh of any kind, but do eat eggs and dairy products are lacto-ovo vegetarians (“lacto” comes from the Latin for milk, and "ovo" for egg).</p>

                <li>Ovo-vegetarian refers to people who do not eat meat or dairy products but do eat eggs.</li>

                           <h5>Vegan</h5>
                            <p>Vegans do not eat meat of any kind and also do not eat eggs, dairy products, or processed foods containing these or other animal-derived ingredients such as gelatin. Many vegans also refrain from eating foods that are made using animal products that may not contain animal products in the finished process, such as sugar and some wines. There is some debate as to whether certain foods, such as honey, fit into a vegan diet.</p>
                            
                            <h5>Raw vegan/Raw food diet</h5>
        <p>A raw vegan diet consists of unprocessed vegan foods that have not been heated above 115 degrees Fahrenheit (46 degrees Celsius). “Raw foodists” believe that foods cooked above this temperature have lost a significant amount of their nutritional value and are harmful to the body.</p>
        					
                            <h5>Macrobiotic</h5>
                            <p>The macrobiotic diet, revered by some for its healthy and healing qualities, includes unprocessed vegan foods, such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and allows the occasional consumption of fish. Sugar and refined oils are avoided. Perhaps the most unique qualifier of the macrobiotic diet is its emphasis on the consumption of Asian vegetables, such as daikon, and sea vegetables, such as seaweed.</p>
