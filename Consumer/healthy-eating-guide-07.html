                            <p>By Tod Peseck, Organic Spa magazine </p>
                            <p>Long revered as a healing herb, research shows that this humble root helps to reduce the effects of stress and boost mental clarity-and that’s just the beginning.</p>
                            <p>Maca is a tuber that is native to South America where it grows in the unique ecosystems of the high Andean mountains. Largely considered an Andean miracle food of sorts, maca roots are traditionally planted and then harvested in ceremony and in cyclical cadence with the earth; traditionally, they are dried naturally in the sun at altitude, and can be stored quite well. When prepared, it takes on a sweet, almost butterscotch-like flavor, and is consumed by local cultures in various ways: Among them are roasting, as tea, as sweet gruel with milk, or made into a flour mixture and used in making breads, cakes, and cookies. It is also prepared as a beverage by blending boiled roots with fruits or spices and water or milk. The miracle of maca is not, however, in its versatility of preparation, but in its wellness conferring attributes-however consumed. </p>
                            <p>Maca has traditionally been used by indigenous peoples as a healing herb and a foodstuff which has an important role in the dynamic interactions of physical, mental, and sexual energies. It has been used as such since before the era of the Inca Empire. Less well-known than its aphrodisiac properties, perhaps, is that it also promotes mental clarity and boosts both endurance and stamina-it can perhaps help you get through your day in this increasingly busy world. This may be because maca is an excellent adaptogen, tailoring its utility to the individual who consumes the root and helping to balance the body’s systems under physical and emotional stress. Researchers have demonstrated that maca refurbishes the impairment caused by stress and hormonal flux. Hormones and bodily processes that react to stress responses can lead to a range of problems, including difficulty concentrating and plain old stress-induced illness. Reducing the effects of stress has a positive outcome on systems and hormonal balance, blood sugar fluctuations, and mental clarity to name a few. This is nearly immediate and so effective that maca is even given to schoolchildren in the Andes during exams to assure good scores. Imagine what it can do for you in your daily tasks!</p>
                           
                           
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4">
                            <p>Maca has been used for millennia in the Andes region as a natural way to boost both male and female fertility. In study after study, it has shown a remarkable ability to work with your body’s unique chemistry to help improve sexual function and fecundity-in both genders. Maca is eaten by Andean women who want to get pregnant. Anecdotal evidence as well as research to support these claims is promising. Remember, this root is an adaptogen with systems balancing properties, so it can potentially serve as a regulator for women with irregular cycles-perhaps by helping reduce the effects of stress on conception efforts and bringing regularity to menstrual cycles, it may become more likely to achieve pregnancy. </p>
                            <p>Maca’s nutritional profile includes phytoestrogens which could allow the herb to stimulate the hormonal balance mentioned earlier. This would not only help regulate cycles, but also decrease cramping and mood changes. Maca has also shown significant promise in helping relieve the difficult symptoms of menopause.  </p>
                            <p>Perhaps one of the reasons maca is so valued by the traditions of the area is its remarkable nutritional makeup-it is an extremely healthful root. Maca contains nearly all of the essential amino acids, as well as high concentrations of the same anticancer compounds found in vegetables like cabbage and broccoli. It plays a role in immune support, as it contains compounds similar to those found in Echinacea. One of the principle antioxidants present in green tea is found in significant concentrations in maca as well. What this means to you is that oxidative stressors leading to degenerative effects of environment and aging-can potentially be reduced by maca consumption</p>
                            <p>The balancing effect of this herb not only helps the individual in the short term, but also in the long term by helping to assist the body to recover more quickly, getting it back to a healthy state. As you are dealing with both mental and physiological stress better, you are more prone to be at harmony with the environment-both the people and the earth around you. By supporting your immune system, you are less likely to suffer setbacks due to illness. More energy is available to reconnect to your spiritual side. You can actually feel the rejuvenating effects of maca on your body. Consider it a nice component to a healthy lifestyle, and an important part of an overall routine for your journey to wellness. </p>

                        <div class="col-md-4">
                        	<h5>Carbohydrates</h5>
                            <p>Your body needs carbohydrates for energy. Carbohydrates are the best fuel for your body, although your body can use fats and proteins for energy if necessary. Since you need to gain weight, you should make sure you get enough carbohydrates to fuel your body as well as add the nutrients you need. Your best sources of carbohydrates are fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</p>
                            
                            <p>Vegetables and fruits should be the cornerstone of any healthy diet. You don't want to avoid healthy green vegetables like green beans and asparagus just because they are low in calories. Green vegetables have a lot of nutritional value. You can add healthy calories to those vegetables by topping them with nutritious foods like olive oil, almonds and shredded cheese. You may also want to eat more of the starchier vegetables such as potatoes and corn. The starchy vegetables pack more calories into regular serving sizes. </p>
                            
                    <p>You can add lots of fruit to your diet too. Fruits are packed with vitamins and phytochemicals that will boost your health. For example, instead of drinking extra sugary sodas, enjoy orange juice or other fruit juice. You will get the calories you need, plus a lot of vitamins that soda doesn't have. Snack on fresh fruits any time of day to increase your calorie intake.</p>
                    
                    <p>Other large sources of carbohydrates are the grains and cereals. The USDA suggests that you eat six to 11 servings of foods from the bread and cereal group. At least three of those servings should be from 100 percent whole grain products. Whole grains are a great source of fiber and nutrients.</p>
                    
                    	<h5>Fats and Oils</h5>
                        <p>Healthy fats include the essential polyunsaturated omega-3 essential fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids. You can only get these fats from your diet and they are important for healthy hair, skin, and neurological function.</p>
                        
                        <p>The omega-3 fats from fish, seafood, canola oil, flax and walnuts are usually deficient in western diets. The lack of omega-3 fatty acids creates an imbalance between the two fatty acids.</p>
                        
                        <p>Most diets contain more than enough of the omega-6 fatty acids. Many experts believe that consuming too much of the omega-6 fatty acids along with insufficient amounts of omega-3 fatty acids is unhealthy. Omega-6 fatty acids are found in most vegetable oils like sunflower oil, safflower oil and corn oil. </p>
                        
                        <p>Monounsaturated fats like olive oil are also good fats that will help keep your cardiovascular system healthy. These fats are found in olive oil. </p>
                        
                        <p>You want to add healthy fats to your diet by eating lots of fish, flax seeds and nuts. Choose salad dressings, cooking oils and mayonnaise made with canola oil.</p>
                        
                        <p>Avoid foods that contain large amounts of saturated fats and trans-fats. Red meat, processed lunch meats, hot dogs and sausage have all been connected with higher risks of diseases such as heart disease and some cancers so you should eat those meats only sparingly. Avoid fried foods as well. Fried foods such as French fries, donuts and fried fish or chicken are sources of trans fats and not a healthy way to get the calories you need.</p>

                            <h5>Proteins</h5>                                
                            <p>The protein sources you choose are important too. Your body needs protein for muscle and organ structure and for normal immune system function. Your body also uses protein to make hormones and brain chemicals called neurotransmitters.</p>
                            
                                                          
                            <p>Healthy protein sources include poultry, fish, legumes, nuts and seeds. Red meat is OK once or twice each week, but more red meat contains a lot of saturated fat. A diet high in saturated fat has been linked to cardiovascular disease. Processed meats like hot dogs, sausages, bologna and other lunch meats are high in calories, but also associated with higher risks of cancer. </p>
                            
                            <h5>Dietary Supplements</h5>                                
                            <p>Taking a multivitamin with extra calcium may be beneficial for many people. "Weight gaining" supplements are available that can add extra calories to your diet. These supplements usually have a lot of protein and carbohydrates. These types of weight gaining supplements are fine, however if you are recovering from an illness, it is good to speak with your doctor first to be sure the extra protein is OK. </p>
                            
                            <h5>Portions Sizes and Meals</h5>                                
                            <p>You can either add more calories to your diet by eating more meals per day, by adding snacks and by increasing your portion sizes. If a large meal makes you feel stuffed and uncomfortable, eat small portions, but eat more often. You can add healthy snacks throughout the day. </p>
                            
                            <h5>Exercise to Gain Weight</h5>                                
                            <p>Exercise is important for good health and the right type of exercise can help you gain muscle, which will give you more body mass. Weight-lifting exercises that are designed to build muscle should be included with your weight-gaining diet and perhaps aerobic exercise should be cut back a bit.

Vitamin C (antioxidant) stimulates sugar burning and increases the iron absorption. It is essential to consume vitamin C through diet because the body can’t produce it. Over consuming vitamin C may lead to diarrhea. It is very beneficial for post-surgery recovery and smokers. It is better not to cook oranges because vitamin C is destroyed by heat. Before any physical activity, the fructose content in orange juice will help in maintaining the sugar level in blood and the water content (85%) will prevent thirst. Consume orange as soon as chopped to prevent the calcium oxidation. People with inflamed stomach may not tolerate orange.</p>
