If you want to lose body fat faster, try incorporating these 5 healthy super-foods into your diet & regular meal plans.
Mike Geary, Certified Personal Trainer, Certified Nutrition Specialist.                                         <br><br>
                                        <p><strong>1. Grass-fed beef or bison</strong> (NOT your typical grocery store beef!) - I know most people think that red meat is unhealthy for you, but that's because they don't understand how the health of the animal affects how healthy the meat is for consumption. Keep this in mind -- "an unhealthy animal provides unhealthy meat, but a healthy animal provides healthy meat". </p>
                                        
                                        <p>Typical beef or bison that you see at the grocery store is raised on grains such as corn and soybeans. Soy and corn are NOT the natural diet of cattle or bison, and therefore changes the chemical balance of fats and other nutrients in the beef or bison. Grain-fed beef and bison are typically WAY too high in omega-6 fatty acids and WAY too low in omega-3 fatty acids. </p>
                                        <p>On the other hand, grass-fed beef from cattle and buffalo (or bison) that were raised on the type of natural foods that they were meant to eat in nature (grass and other forage), have much higher levels of healthy omega-3 fatty acids and lower levels of inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids (that most people already eat way too much of) compared to grain fed beef or bison. </p>
                    <p>Grass fed meats also typically contain up to 3 times the Vitamin E as in grain fed meats. </p>
                  <p>
                  Not only that, but grass-fed meat from healthy cattle or bison also contain a special healthy fat called conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in MUCH higher levels than grain-fed meat. CLA has been proven in scientific studies in recent years to help in burning fat and building lean muscle (which can help you lose weight!). These benefits are on top of the fact that grass-fed meats are some of the highest quality proteins that you can possibly eat... and this also aids in burning fat and building lean muscle. </p>
                  
                  <p>Grass-fed meats are a little harder to find, but just ask your butcher or find a specialty grocery store and they usually have cuts available. I've also found a good site to order grass-fed meats online - 
                  <a href="http://healthygrassfed.2ya.com"> http://healthygrassfed.2ya.com</a></p>
                  
                  <p><strong>2. Avocodos</strong> - Even though these are typically thought of as a "fatty food", it's all healthy fats! Not only is this fruit super-high in mono-unsaturated fat, but also chock full of vitamins, minerals, micronutrients, and antioxidants.  </p>
                  
                  <p>Also, I think guacamole (mashed avocados with garlic, onion, tomato, pepper, etc) is one of the most delicious toppings ever created, and you can be happy to know that it's also one of the healthiest toppings you can use on your foods. Try sliced avocados or guacamole on sandwiches, burgers, scrambled eggs or omelets, in salads, or as a side to just about any meal. </p>
                  <p>The quality dose of healthy fats and other nutrition you get from avocados helps your body to maintain proper levels of hormones that help with fat loss and muscle building. Also, since avocados are an extremely satiating food, eating them helps to reduce your appetite in the hours after your meal. Say goodbye to junk food cravings and bring on that lean body!  </p>
               <p><strong>3. Whole Eggs, including the yolk</strong> (not just egg whites) - Most people know that eggs are one of the highest quality sources of protein. However, most people don't know that the egg yolks are the healthiest part of the egg... that's where almost all of the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants (such as lutein) are found in eggs.  </p>
               
                                        
                                    
                            </div>        
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4">
                            <div class="accordion-text roboto">
                                <p>Egg Yolks contain more than 90% of the calcium, iron, phosphorus, zinc, thiamin, B6, folate, and B12, and pantothenic acid of the egg. In addition, the yolks contain ALL of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K in the egg, as well as ALL of the essential fatty acids. Also, the protein of whole eggs is more bio-available than egg whites alone due to a more balanced amino acid profile that the yolks help to build. </p>
                                        <p>Just make sure to choose free-range organic eggs instead of normal grocery store eggs. Similar to the grass-fed beef scenario, the nutrient content of the eggs and the balance between healthy omega-3 fatty acids and inflammatory omega-6 fatty acids (in excess) is controlled by the diet of the chickens. </p>
                                        <p>Chickens that are allowed to roam free outside and eat a more natural diet will give you healthier, more nutrient-rich eggs with a healthier fat balance compared with your typical grocery store eggs (that came from chickens fed nothing but soy and corn and crowded inside "egg factories" all day long). </p>
                                        <p><strong>4. Nuts: Walnuts, Almonds, Pecans, Macadamia, etc </strong>- Yes, this is yet another "fatty food" that can actually help you burn fat! Although nuts are generally between 75-90% fat in terms of a ratio of fat calories to total calories, this is another type of food that is all healthy fats, along with high levels of nutrition such as vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Nuts are also a good source of fiber and protein, which of course, helps to control blood sugar and can aid in weight loss.</p>
                                        <p>Nuts also help to maintain good levels of fat burning hormones in your body as well as helping to control appetite and cravings so that you essentially eat less calories overall, even though you're consuming a high-fat food. My favorite healthy nuts are pecans, almonds, and walnuts, and by eating them in variety, you help to broaden the types of vitamins and minerals and also the balance of polyunsaturated to monounsaturated fats you obtain. </p>
                                        <p>Try to find raw nuts instead of roasted nuts if you can, as it helps to maintain the quality and nutritional content of the healthy fats that you will eat.  </p>
                                        <p>Also, try to broaden your horizons beyond the typical peanut butter that most people eat, and try almond butter, pecan butter, or macadamia butter to add variety to your diet. </p>
                                        <p><strong>5. Berries</strong> - including blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and even the "exotic" Goji berry:Berries are a powerhouse of nutrition... packed with vitamins and minerals, and also some of the best sources of antioxidants of any food in existence. Berries also pack a healthy dose of fiber, which slows your carbohydrate absorption and digestion and controls your blood sugar levels to help prevent insulin spikes (which can stimulate fat gain). </p>
                                        <p>Get creative and mix up your berry intake by using the basics - blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries... but also get adventurous and give a more "exotic" berry a try, such as Goji berries (which are one of the most nutrient-dense berries on the planet). </p>
                                        <p>I like to add berries to my yogurt and cottage cheese mixtures, as well as oatmeal or oat bran, salads, or just taking a bag of mixed berries and mixed nuts with me for the day as a mid-day healthy snack! </p>
                                        <p>I hope you enjoyed this look at some of the healthiest fat-burning foods you can possibly eat. I could list a ton more, but wanted to give you my favorites for now!</p>

<p>January 29, 2009 — Exposure to a type of chemical found in everyday items such as clothing, carpets, and food packaging may be adversely affecting women's fertility, delaying the time it takes them to become pregnant, according to a new study.         </p><br>
                                        <p>In the study, the higher the concentrations of these chemicals -- called perfluorinated chemicals (PFCs) -- in the women's blood samples, the more likely the women were to take more than 12 months to get pregnant. </p>
                                        
                                        <p>"In our study, 75% of the women had concentrations that were associated with a longer waiting time [to pregnancy]," says study researcher Jorn Olsen, MD, PhD, professor and chair of epidemiology at the University of California School of Public Health. Olsen heads the Danish National Birth Cohort at the University of Aarhus in Denmark. </p>
                    <p>The study is published online in the journal Human Reproduction. </p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, representatives of manufacturers who use the chemicals say the study shows only an association, not a cause and effect, as Olsen also emphasizes. Major manufacturers who use the chemicals are participating in a voluntary phase-out of them.</p>
                  <h5>Measuring PFC Levels </h5>
                  <p>
                  Olsen and his colleagues took blood samples from 1,240 women during their first pregnancy visit, when they were about four to 14 weeks pregnant, and measured concentrations of the chemicals. The researchers asked the women how long it took to become pregnant; they defined infertility as a "time to pregnancy" of longer than 12 months or the need for infertility treatment to become pregnant.</p>
                  
                  <p>The women were part of the Danish National Birth Cohort, a study of women recruited from 1996 to 2002; most were 25 to 34. "We divided the women into equal size groups, lowest, higher, [even] higher, and highest values [of the chemicals]," Olsen tells WebMD. "We made the comparison between these groups'' in looking at the time to pregnancy.</p>
                  
                  <p>They measured concentrations of two types of PFCs: PFOS (perfluorooctanesulfonate) and PFOAs (perfluorooctanoate). The chemicals are used to make such products as nonstick cookware and breathable clothing, among other items.</p>
                  
                  <p>Compared to the women with the lowest levels of PFOS, women in the next three groups, with progressively higher levels of PFOS concentrations, had greater odds of taking more than 12 months to become pregnant. For instance, those in the group with the third highest concentration range of PFOS had a 2.34 times greater odds of taking more than 12 months to become pregnant than the women in the group with the lowest blood levels of the chemical. </p>
                  
                  <p>The same was true for the concentrations of PFOAs, with women in the groups with the higher concentrations taking longer to become pregnant than women in the lowest concentration group. For instance, those with the next highest concentration of PFOAs had a two times greater odds of taking 12 months or more to become pregnant, compared to the women with the lowest concentrations of PFOAs. </p>
                  
               <p>"This is just an association study," Olsen says. It doesn't prove cause and effect, nor does it explain how the chemical exposures might affect fertility. </p>
               <p>It's possible that high levels of the chemicals in the blood stream may affect the menstrual cycle, Olsen speculates, and that in turn could affect fertility. </p>
               <p>In recent decades, the fertility rates in developed countries have declined, Olsen notes in the study report. While much of the decline can be explained by wishes to have a smaller family size and better contraception, he says some may also be due to reduced fertility. And chemical exposures may partially explain that reduction, he says. </p>
               <p>Olsen hopes others will study the same association to see if they come up with the same findings. "If this finding can be replicated, I think we have one of the explanations for the frequent problem of long waiting times [to pregnancy]," he says. </p>

                                <h5>Second Opinions </h5>
                                        <p>The majority of Americans probably have concentrations of PFCs in their blood, says Olga Naidenko, PHD, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental research organization based in Washington, D.C., who reviewed the study for WebMD. "It has been used very widely and has now contaminated the environment," she says of the chemicals. The new study adds information about the effects of exposure to the chemicals on reproduction, she says. </p>
                                        <p>"What they are basically seeing is that the reproductive health of these women has been severely affected by the PFCs," she says. "It is a painful shock. I don't know if I would call it a surprise." </p>
                                        
                                        <p>"This is a preliminary finding," says John Heinze, PhD, a special consultant to the Fluoropolymer Products Information Center of the Society of Plastics Industries, who also reviewed the study for WebMD. </p>
                                        
                                        <p>Much follow-up research will be needed, he says, to demonstrate meaning for human health. Dan Turner, a spokesman for DuPont, which makes the chemicals, issued a statement that says, in part: "We are reviewing the study. The weight of evidence continues to indicate to us that there is no health risk to the general population." </p>
                                        
                                        <h5>Goals to Reduce Use of PFOAs </h5>
                                        <p>Efforts are under way to reduce the use of the chemicals. In 2006, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched the 2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program, in which eight major companies, including DuPont, agreed voluntarily to reduce the use of PFOA and related chemicals by 95% no later than 2010. </p>
                                        
                                        <p>Also, try to broaden your horizons beyond the typical peanut butter that most people eat, and try almond butter, pecan butter, or macadamia butter to add variety to your diet. </p>
                                        
                                        <h5>The plan is to eliminate use of the chemicals by 2015. </h5>
                                        <p>The EPA began to investigate PFOA "because it is very persistent in the environment,'' according to information on the EPA web site. ''It was being found at very low levels both in the environment and in the blood of the general U.S. population, and it caused developmental and other adverse effects in laboratory animals." </p>
                                        
                                        <p>What can consumers do to minimize exposure, especially if they are trying to become pregnant? "Exposures that come from products are very low," Heinze, the industry consultant, says. "It's not a reason to discontinue using consumer products." Exposure to environmental chemicals is more the issue, he says. </p>
                                        
                                        <p>According to the EPA, routine use of household products made with the chemicals does not pose a concern, based on the information available to the agency. </p>

                                <p>Bovine somatotropin (bST) is a hormone that occurs naturally in animals; it regulates growth and lactation. BST has no effect on humans. Recombinant bST (rbST) is a commercially produced version of the natural hormone and it can increase milk production by 10 to 15%. But it may also increase the risk of mastitis and infertility and cause lameness in cows, which is why Health Canada has not approved it. It is important to note that bST has not been shown to have a negative effect on human health and its use is permitted in other countries (such as the United States), where it is considered safe. www.dairygoodness.ca/en/.../cows-and-hormones.htm

                           <p>The publicity has been both favorable with reports of short-term weight loss success and improved levels of good cholesterol (HDL) and triglycerides and unfavorable with reports of potential negative health consequences. Some physicians, nutritionists, and researchers have questioned the safety of the low-carb diets. </p>
                          <h5>How Low Carb Diets Work</h5>
                          <p>You know all these so called "low fat" foods that are sold in your local supermarket? These foods are typically calorie ridden and will actually make you gain more weight! This is just one of the fallacies that will encourage you to eat more of this food! </p>
                          <h5>Summarily, here's how it works: </h5>
                          <p>A lower daily intake of carbohydrates causes the body to burn stored carbohydrates for energy. As this process of burning stored carbohyrates (a.k.a. glycogen) occurs, water is released, and weight loss follows. The body also begins to burn fat for energy. Such a diet is called a "ketogenic" diet because it causes an accumulation of ketones (by-products of fat oxidation) in the bloodstream (which are removed by the kidneys). </p>
                          <h5>The theory:</h5>
                          <p>In a state of what has been called perpetual ketosis or benign dietary ketosis, a person loses weight no matter how many calories are consumed from fat and protein.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4">
                           <h5>Hollywood Diets</h5>
                           <p>The only diet that seems popular in Hollywood is the one where the actors and actresses forget to eat. There are also the ridiculous "cookie" diets, secret potion "syrup and water' diets... Let's get real, these people are not like us and they do not need the nutrition that a normal person needs to maintain a healthy weight. 
</p>
							<p>So, if all of these diets don't work, what does it take to strip unwanted fat from your body? ...And Why Are YOU Still Overweight? </p>
                            <p> Do YOU eat the wrong foods?</p>
							<p>Do YOU sneak into McDonalds for a latenight meal?</p> 
							<p>Do YOU eat during the wrong times of the day? </p>
							<p>Do YOU eat empty calories while watchingyour favorite TV Show? </p>
							<p>How about exercise, do YOU forget to walkyour dog? </p>
                            <p>Notice that 4 of the items were related to food and only one was exercise. This is because diet is 80% of the battle, and exercise is only 20%. Most overweight people get enough exercise, but what they "eat" prevents them from getting that fit, healthy waistline! </p>
                            <p>The food you eat will either make you lose weight or gain weight. Conventional wisdom has always told us to eat our breakfast, lunch and dinner every day, however there is more to it than this…and actually eating 3 big meals per day is not good for our body. </p>
                            <p>What if we told you that you could burn more calories and have a better metabolism simply by eating more often? How do 5 meals a day sound? </p>
                            <p>
Well, this is the truth. If you eat smaller meals and eat the right foods, you can actually eat more and lose more weight! Sounds strange, but our bodies are very complex and if you understand your body, you can truly manipulate your metabolism for speedy and sustainable weight loss!</p>

                          <p>By Melissa Breyer, Senior Editor, Care2 Healthy & Green Living </p>
                          
                          <p>It's the season for festivities, feasting, and perhaps a few extra pounds-but according to a new alert by the FDA, 'tis definitely not the season for diet pills. The FDA is warning consumers nationwide not to purchase or consume more than 25 different products marketed for weight loss. And if you think that "natural" dietary supplements or those labeled as containing only "herbal" ingredients are safe, think again. </p>
                          
                          <p>FDA analysis found undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients in many of these products - and in some cases "prescription drugs in amounts that greatly exceed their maximum recommended dosages," according to Janet Woodcock, M.D., director, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA. The list includes sibutramine (a controlled substance), rimonabant (a drug not approved for marketing in the United States), phenytoin (an anti-seizure medication), and phenolphthalein (a solution used in chemical experiments and a suspected cancer causing agent). Some of the amounts of active pharmaceutical ingredients far exceeded the FDA-recommended levels, putting consumers' health at risk. This is really shocking. </p>
 
                          <p>The FDA site warns that the health risks posed by these products can be very serious. For example, sibutramine, which was found (but unlisted) in many of the products, can cause high blood pressure, seizures, tachycardia, palpitations, heart attack or stroke. This drug can also interact with other medications that patients may be taking and increase their risk of adverse drug events. </p>
