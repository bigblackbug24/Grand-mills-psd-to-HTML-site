                            <p>The ginger origin is believed to be South East Asian, especially cultivated in china, India, Jamaica and many African countries. The Jamaican ginger is mostly used in Pharmaceutical products. It is known to be a general medicine that strengthens the heart and warms the body in winter. The useable part of the ginger is its root.</p>
		<h5>Chemical structure:</h5>
<p>
The roots contain fat, starch and essential oils, which include Camphene, linalool, and non-volatile resin (gingerene), which give the ginger the special odor and the spicy flavor.</p>
                           
                            <p>There are even more minerals like Iron, Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Selenium but they are in a smaller quantity.</p>

                            <p>Jonathan Silver, MD
In a GEM of a study, another alternative treatment bites the dust.</p>
                            
                            <p>Several preclinical studies have suggested that Ginkgo biloba extract is neuroprotective, although some treatment studies (including meta-analyses) have shown little cognitive benefit. Americans are estimated to spend $100 million yearly on gingko in the hope that it enhances memory or prevents memory loss. To ascertain whether G. biloba prevents all-cause dementia and Alzheimer disease, researchers conducted the Ginkgo Enhancement of Memory (GEM) study, a multisite, randomized, and controlled 6-year trial.</p>
                            <p>Researchers used an adequate sample size (calculated to detect a 30% reduction in dementia cases at 96% power). Individuals with mild cognitive impairment were included, but those with dementia were excluded, as were those treated with cholinesterase inhibitors, anticoagulants, and other potentially confounding treatments or conditions. The 3069 community volunteers (minimum age, 75) underwent a full baseline neuropsychological battery, were randomized to standardized G. biloba extract (120 mg twice daily) or placebo, and were reevaluated every 6 months. Participants with indications of cognitive decline retook the test battery; an expert panel reviewed results and clinical reports, finally referring patients for full neurologic evaluations and MRI scans for confirmation of dementia.</p>
                           
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4">
                        
                         <p>Dementia was diagnosed in 523 participants (placebo, 16.1%; ginkgo, 17.9%), with no between-group difference in baseline clinical characteristics or dropout rates. At study's end, 60.3% of participants were still taking the medication. Rates of all-cause or Alzheimer-type dementia did not differ between the two groups, although the number of hemorrhagic strokes was non-significantly higher in the gingko group</p>
                            <h5>Comment</h5>                                
                            <p>This well-planned and well-executed study definitively answers the question of whether G. biloba prevents dementia: It does not, even in those with incipient dementia. The authors argue that because of dementia´s slow process, G. biloba given for a longer duration might be effective, and they plan further MRI analyses of some subjects. As an editorialist discusses, the investigators did not include data on overall cognitive decline or functional disability in this report. However, considering the lack of efficacy reported here, these measures are unlikely to yield positive findings. In the present economy, people can put the $100 million to better use.</p>

                            <h5>Licorice:</h5> 
                            <p>This root contains vitamin E, vitamin B group, Biotin, Niacin and Pantothenic Acid Lecithin, manganese and other minerals. Licorice is used to sweeten laxatives and drugs used to treat cough in children. Researchers were able to extract substances from the roots of licorice, which are used in the manufacture of some drugs, tobacco and sweets. This extract was added to drugs used in the treatments of rheumatism; the initial tests gave excellent results. Research has demonstrated that licorice can achieve good results in many of the treatments as a blood cleanser, and one of its compounds is used successfully in the treatment of Addison's disease, a type of anemia. As experiments are showing promises, researchers could investigate the use of licorice products and extracts in the treatment of sores and infections of the stomach and intestine.

                            <p>Grapes are one of the most beneficial fruits and it has an effective role in building the body structure and repairing its tissues. </p>
                                
                            <p>Grapes are considered as the oldest fruit in history, every 100 gram of grapes contains 75 Calories and every 1 cup of grape juice contains 150 Calories.</p>
                            
                            <p>Grapes are an ancient fruit; it was mentioned in the Torah, myths, the Holy Qur’an and in the earliest tales. The Greeks had devoted one of their gods to wine that is made of grapes and many tales and myths were said. It’s not exactly known what is the grapes’ origin but it is believed that western Asia is the closest possibility. </p>
                            
                            <p>Grapes contain 15% Carbohydrates of which 7% is glucose and the percentage increases with the ripening of the fruit. It was found that consuming 100 grams of grapes will provide the body with 75 calories. This energy is the product of metabolizing carbohydrates that are found in grapes. Grapes are rich in carbohydrates that the liver stores to be used when needed as in the case of fasting. Grapes contain 0.8% protein, 0.5% fat and some minerals such as potassium, calcium, phosphorus and iron. Grapes skin is rich in vitamin B complex that is involved in many biological activities in the body and it is a very important factor for the neurological system integrity. It also contains a significant amount of vitamin C that maintains the body’s immunity and lowers the incident of getting microbial infection. </p>
                            
                            <p>Grapes are a great source of Fiber that prevent constipation, regulates the blood sugar and cholesterol and protects the body against bowel cancer.</p>
                            
                            <p>The medical and therapeutic uses of grapes:</p>

                            <li><p>Helps in the urine retention cases: grapes increase the urine excretion. The urine retention elevates the urea in the blood which will negatively affect the neurological system and the brain. It also causes salt accumulation in the urinary tracts which helps in the formation of kidney stones.</p></li>
                            <li><p>Treating Gout disease: it is a disease that occurs due to the accumulation of uric acid in the blood which is one of the purines metabolism byproducts. The uric acid crystals deposit in joints, especially in big knuckled persons.</p></li>

                           <p>Raisins are dried grapes. Raisins contain the same grapes contents, but they provide more calories. 100 grams of raisins provides 268 calories, whereas 100 grams of grapes will provide 68 calories only.</p>
                           <p>In the cases that don’t allow grapes consumption, raisins are a good substitution. In this case, raisins are consumed every 2 hours and to overcome its sweetness, add lemon juice to them. The seedless raisins help in relieving pain, curing pulmonary diseases, stimulating liver function and treating the urinary tract diseases.</p>
                           <h5>Summary</h5>
                           <p>Grapes are one of the most beneficial fruits, they have a great effect on repairing the body tissues and they are very beneficial for athletes. These benefits apply only to the fresh grape juice, while the artificial juice contains no more than 20% of grape juice added to water, sugar and artificial flavors.</p>

                            <p>Lutein and zeaxanthin are two very important antioxidant carotenoids. Originally, they were to be included in the AREDS formulation of antioxidants, but at the time no reliable commercial suppliers of lutein were available so lutein and zeaxanthin were dropped from the final formulation.</p>
                            
                            <p>While the AREDS was underway, more evidence emerged to support the theory that lutein and zeaxanthin played an important role in the development and treatment of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).</p>
                            
                            <p>Carotenoids are the yellow pigments found in fruits and vegetables. Lutein and zeaxanthin are two carotenoids primarily found in dark green leafy vegetables, like spinach. They're also found in the macula of your eyes. Lutein and zeaxanthin make up the bulk of the pigments contained in your macula and yet the only way your body can get them is through diet. In fact, the yellow appearance, and the name macula lutea, is due to the dense concentration of lutein. </p>
                            
                            <p>If you eat a diet high in lutein, your body will have more of it to absorb and put to use, which is a good thing because scientists have long suspected a link between the amount of lutein in your system, your macular pigment, and the development of AMD. In fact, studies have shown that people with AMD have lower levels of lutein and zeaxanthin in their maculas.</p>
                            <p>One study in particular has shown that levels of lutein and zeaxanthin naturally decline with age, leveling off at about age 60. This same study also showed that people with AMD had even lower levels of these carotenoids - 32% lower. What's even more interesting is that people who began taking a lutein supplement in excess of four milligrams (4 mg) per day saw their macular lutein levels return to normal.</p>
                            
                            <p>Another earlier, large scale study showed that people with AMD who ate a diet rich in lutein and zeaxanthin had a 57% lower chance of developing wet AMD. The people in this group consumed close to 6 mg of lutein per day. That's about the same as one large bowl of raw spinach salad per day. Unfortunately, most people, especially seniors, don't come close to getting that much lutein each day. The average diet provides only about one to three milligrams (1-3 mg) of lutein per day.</p>
                           
                           <p>There are numerous other studies demonstrating the relationship between lutein, zeaxanthin and AMD. Some have shown that the harmful effects of blue light on the retina can lead to AMD. Blue light is a component of natural sunlight and when it reaches the retina, it can be harmful to the photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium, which are essential to vision. A healthy macular pigment acts as a filter, absorbing most of the blue light before it reaches the photoreceptors. Conversely, more blue light gets through to the retinas of people with low concentrations of lutein in their maculas, creating a higher risk of developing AMD. </p>
                           
                           
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-md-4">
                        	<p>Taken together, all of these studies demonstrate a strong link between lutein, zeaxanthin and AMD. Anyone with, or at risk of developing AMD, should consult their eye-care professional about taking an AREDS formula vitamin supplement. They should also consider increasing their daily intake of lutein and zeaxanthin, either through diet, or supplements. </p>
