<p>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) Apr 16 - United Airlines will require obese passengers bumped from full flights to purchase two seats on a subsequent flight, matching the policy of some other carriers.</p>
                                        
<p>The change brings the Chicago-based in line with eight other airlines including Continental, Delta, JetBlue and Southwest, United spokeswoman Robin Urbanski said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>"Last year we had 700 complaints from passengers who had to share their seats," she said.</p>

<p>Under the new policy, obese passengers -- defined as unable to lower the arm rest and buckle a seat belt with one extension belt -- will still be reaccommodated, at no extra charge, to two empty seats if there is space available. </p>

<p>If the airplane is full, however, they will be bumped from the flight and may have to purchase a second ticket, at the same price as the original fare, Urbanski said.</p>

<p>If the bumped passenger chooses to cancel the trip, the ticket will be refunded with no additional charge.</p>

<p>The policy is effective immediately.</p>

                            <p>One of the most common questions vegetarians hear from non-vegetarians is “Where do you get your protein?” Of course, the folks who wonder this may guzzle chicken wings by the bucket and soda by the gallon, never stopping to think where they get their fiber or vitamin C. Vegetarian, vegan or not, we all need to consider the health effects of what we eat. While it’s true that protein is necessary, calcium and iron are equally important for vegetarians; and, if you’re vegan, vitamin B12 is as important as the above mentioned.</p>
                            
<p>If you’re eating a well-balanced vegetarian diet with plenty of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, you are eating one of the healthiest diets on the planet. You do, however, need to make sure you get a few vital nutrients. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="accordion-text">
                            <h5>Protein</h5>
                            <p>The little known truth about protein is that most of us get too much, not too little of it. Women need about 45 grams per day and men need around 55 grams. One cup of tofu contains about 20 grams of protein, so women, eat some tofu and you’re almost halfway there! Lots of foods contain protein and if you’re eating a well-balanced diet, you’re probably consuming more than enough protein without even thinking about it. Even though it’s quite easy to get plenty of protein on a vegetarian or vegan diet, it’s a good idea to make sure you’re eating a variety of protein-rich foods. If you’re a lacto-ovo vegetarian, you’ll likely get sufficient protein from eggs and dairy without even trying, but if you’re vegan, here are some high protein vegan foods to include in your diet: tofu, veggie burgers, soy, lentils, chickpeas, nuts and seeds, brown rice and whole grains. </p>
                            
                            <h5>Calcium</h5>
                            <p>Kids need lots of calcium while they’re still growing, but adults need calcium too! If you’re a smoker, you will need to get more calcium, as your absorption and retention levels are lower. Strong bones throughout life come from both calcium in the diet and exercise, so for optimum health, be sure you get both. Although milk is a source of calcium, you certainly don’t need milk to get plenty of calcium. Here are some calcium-rich foods to try: spinach, collard greens, kale, soy milk, fortified orange juice, sesame seeds, tahini broccoli, almonds, carrots, and rice milk. Be sure to shake your soy milk and orange juice before drinking, as the calcium can settle to the bottom. </p>
                            
                            <h5>Iron</h5>
                            <p>A study published in the British Journal of Nutrition found that iron levels in vegetarians and vegans in the UK were, on average, higher than those of the general population, showing that it’s possible to get more than enough iron on a vegan diet. Just like with protein, however, you should still be sure to eat a balanced diet to ensure you are getting enough iron. Drinking coffee and tea, particularly with meals, can limit your absorption and should be consumed at least three hours before a meal. For an iron boost, try eating tofu, lentils, spinach, soy, chickpeas and hummus. Vitamin C also increases the absorption of iron, so if you take an iron supplement, wash it down with some orange juice!</p>

                            <h5>Vitamin B12</h5>
                            <p>Vegetarians don’t have to worry about vitamin B12, and many people disagree about whether or not vegans need a B12 supplement. I like to go with “better safe than sorry” on this one. B12 deficiency is extremely rare amongst both vegans and non-vegetarians alike, but is a serious issue when it does occur. 
</p>
           <h5>here are a few things vegans should know about B12.</h5>                 
<p>Your body has the ability to store B12 for a number of years, so if you’re newly vegan, you may have sufficient reserves for another decade, but unless you have your B12 levels tested regularly there is no way of knowing.</p>

<p>Nutritional yeast is the best food source for B12, although miso and some seaweed contain a minimal amount as well. </p>
  
<p>Although nutritional yeast is a great source and an incredibly tasty addition to just about everything, some doctors suggest its best not to rely on a single source and recommend taking a vitamin supplement at least once a week, even if you regularly eat nutritional yeast. So if you’re vegan, please be better safe than sorry and take a supplement at least once a week.</p>
                            
<p>Once again, if you’re a smoker, your body will lose nutrients, so you need extra B12.</p>

<p>Expectant mothers and infants have special B12 needs as well. If you’re vegan and expecting, take a supplement every day.
</p>

<p>Remember, eating a healthy vegetarian diet is one of the best things you can do for your short-term and long-term health. As a vegetarian or vegan, you will lower your cholesterol and have a greatly reduced risk for colon cancer, heart disease and high blood pressure. There is a big difference, however, between eating a vegan diet of french fries and soda, and a well-balanced plant-based diet. If you’re still exploring how to be vegetarian or vegan, its likely that you’re not as familiar with your body’s nutritional needs so its a good idea to take a multi-vitamin. A B12 supplement is always a good idea for vegans and those who eat a mostly vegan diet.</p>

<p>A food allergy is an immune system response to a food that the body mistakenly believes is harmful. Once the immune system decides that a particular food is harmful, it creates specific antibodies to it.</p>
<p>The next time the individual eats that food, the immune system releases huge amounts of chemicals in order to protect the body.</p>
                                        
             <p>Body Parts affected by Allergy:</p>
                    <p>These chemicals trigger a number of allergic symptoms that can affect the respiratory system (lungs and breathing), gastrointestinal tract (stomach and bowels), skin, or cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels).</p>
                  <h5>What foods cause allergies?</h5>
                  <p>90% of all food-allergic reactions:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                  	<li>Milk</li>
                    <li>Tree nut (walnut, cashew, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Fish</li>
                    <li>Egg</li>
                    <li>Shellfish</li>
                    <li>Peanut</li>
                    <li>Soy</li>
                    <li>Wheat</li>
                  </ul>
                   <h5>How to Avoid Allergic Reactions?</h5>
                  <p>Strict avoidance of the allergen is necessary for avoiding a severe reaction. Read food labels for every food each and every time you eat it. Ask questions about ingredients and preparation methods when eating away from home.</p>
                  <p>Ask people who offer you food if it contains peanuts or peanut butter.</p>
                  <p>If you can’t read the ingredients list – don’t eat it! </p>
                  <p>Anything that says NUTS Peanut oil – there are some people who can tolerate peanut oil, and others who can’t. Cold pressed peanut oil is usually not tolerated.</p>
                  <p><strong>Peanut flour:</strong> 
Peanuts can show up in unsuspecting places, but they are especially prevalent in Chinese dishes, egg rolls, chocolates, candy bars, and pastries. 
Some surprising foods that have a label indicating "may include peanuts" or "processed in a plant containing peanuts":</p>                     <ul>
					 	<li>Plain M&M’s®</li>
                        <li>Jelly Belly’s (jelly beans)</li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>The most effective form of treatment for a food allergy is medication; true or false?</p>
                     <p>The correct answer is False
The most effective form of treatment for a food allergy is avoiding the problem foods. If an individual can completely remove a food from their diet, they can prevent allergic reactions to that food from happening. There are medications that can help reduce the symptoms of a food allergy, but they can’t cure it…</p>
					<h5>What is anaphylaxis?</h5>
                     <p>Anaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic reaction that can involve various areas of the body (such as the skin, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and cardiovascular system).</p>
                     <p>Anaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic reaction that can involve various areas of the body (such as the skin, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and cardiovascular system).</p>
                     <p>Symptoms occur within minutes to two hours after contact with the allergy-causing substance, but in rare instances may occur up to four hours later.</p>
                     <p>Anaphylactic reactions can be mild to life-threatening. Yearly only 30 per 100,000 persons experience anaphylaxis, and individuals with asthma, eczema, or hay fever are at greater risk of experiencing anaphylaxis. 
</p>
					 <h5>Who is at risk of experiencing anaphylaxis?</h5>
                     <p>Only a trace amount of a problem food can cause a reaction in some individuals.</p>
                     <p>adolescents who have peanut and tree nut allergy and asthma and don't have quick access to epinephrine during a reaction, are at highest risk for anaphylaxis. </p>
                     <p>Find out where in your school the EPIPENS are located…</p>
                     <p>Discuss the symptoms of an anaphylaxis with the persons responsible for the EPIPENS, so, they can recognize a reaction when they see it happening…

                                <h5>What are the Symptoms of Anaphylaxis reaction? </h5>
                   <p>An anaphylactic reaction may begin with a tingling sensation, itching, or metallic taste in the mouth.</p>
                 <p>Other symptoms can include hives, a sensation of warmth, swelling of the mouth and throat area. (skin)</p>
                                        <p>Difficulty breathing, asthma symptoms. (lungs)</p>
                                        <p>Vomiting, diarrhea, cramping. (stomach and bowels)</p>
                                        <p>A drop in blood pressure, and loss of consciousness. (heart).</p>
                                        <p>These symptoms may begin in as little as five to 15 minutes to up to two hours after exposure to the allergen, but life-threatening reactions may progress over hours.</p>
                                        
                                        <h5>3 R's for treating anaphylaxis:</h5>
                                        <p>Recognize symptoms, especially if you know the person has an allergy.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>React quickly; don’t waste time; call friends, teachers, class mates for help.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Review what happened and be sure to prevent it from happening again.</p>
                                        
                                        <h5>Precautions at Home: </h5>
                                       <p>We take the following precautions at home to avoid cross-contamination of peanuts:</p>
                             <p>No nuts or peanuts allowed in the house. If we receive a gift from someone that contains nuts, we immediately remove the item from our house.</p>
                             <p>Peanut butter is sometimes eaten by non-allergic family members. When the sandwich is prepared at home, the allergic person has to be told to stay away from the countertop. The knife used in the peanut butter is not used in the jelly jar. A separate spoon is used to obtain the jelly. The knife is washed with a paper towel, which can be disposed of. The countertop is cleaned off with a paper towel after the sandwich is made. Should we be packing a picnic, no peanut butter sandwiches are allowed. Some people have banned peanut butter or their child’s allergen from their home entirely. However, it is good practice for the allergic person to know the smell of peanut butter (if he/she does not have airborne reactions). This way he can recognize what to stay away from. Someone suggested another way of dealing with the jelly jar: she buys the squeeze bottles of Welch’s jelly for her peanut allergic daughter to use. No knives can get into the squeeze bottle, and only her daughter is allowed to use it.</p>
                            <p>We do not allow the allergic person to eat food prepared at other people’s houses. If he/she goes to someone’s house, he/she brings his/her own food. We tell people ahead of time about his/her allergies in case they have recently made a peanut snack. This allows them to clean off countertops or play areas.</p>
                            <p>We tell people (waiters, waitresses, and counter people) in restaurants about his allergies upon ordering food using his chef card. We ask them to not allow his food to get near nuts.</p>
                            <p>Family members might occasionally eat peanuts outside or at home. Again, the allergic person recognizes the smell, and if he/she doesn’t have airborne reactions, then it is all right, We should use extreme precautions of washing countertops and dishes with hot, soapy water after contact with peanuts. We should wash our hands after the meal before any contact with the allergic person.</p>  
                            <p>Classroom at school is peanut/nut free; however the entire school is not. Therefore, other teachers do use peanuts/nuts in their classrooms for various projects and for snacks. There are now several children in the elementary school with nut allergies, and extreme caution has been taken with hand washing in the classroom so that communal bathrooms are not affected. Also, the projects aren’t allowed outside of the classrooms that include peanuts/nuts. These projects are becoming much rarer as more and more children are diagnosed with food allergies.</p>
